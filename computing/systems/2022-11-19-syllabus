    - xinu 5k LoC
    - xv6 10k LoC
        - no networking stack
    - minix 100k LoC
        - Minix is another good candidate. Versions 1 and 2 were intended as teaching OSes but version 3 no longer targets that goal. I know Minx 2 had a network stack and I think Minix 1 did as well. There is a textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation by Tanenbaum that goes along with Minix.
