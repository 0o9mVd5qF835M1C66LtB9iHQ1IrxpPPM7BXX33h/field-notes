capitalism and freedom (1962)
=============================

INTRODUCTION
  - president kennedy said
    - ask not what your country can do for you,
    - ask what you can do for your country
    - the free man will ask neither of those questions
    - the free man asks "what can i and my compatriots do *though* government
      - to help us discharge our individual responsibilities
      - to achieve our several goals and purposes
      - and above all, preserve freedom
    - he will also acompany the question with another
    - "how can we keep the government we create from becoming a frankenstein
      - a frankeinstein that will destroy the very freedom we establish it to protect?"

  - even though med who wield power intially are ones of goodwill
    - and even though they be not corrupted by the power they exercise
    - the power will both attract and form men of a *different stamp*
    - how do we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the threat to freedom?
    - through two broad principles emboded in our constitution give the answer
    - it has preserved our freedom so far, but also violated repeatedly in practice

  1. the scope of government must be *limited*
    - it's major function should be to protect our freedom
    - both from enemies on the ouside
    - and from our fellow citizens on the inside

  2. government power should be *dispersed*
    - essentially a free market, creating competition for community
    - where one lives

  - people think centralization will enable change more effectively
    - in a sense they are right, but miss the forest for the trees
    - the power to do good is also the power to do harm
    - they are two sides of the same coin
    - the great tragedy of the drive to centralization
    - and the drive to expand scope of government
    - is mostly led by men of goodwill
    - but will be the first to rue its consequences

  - the preservation of freedom is the protective reason for
    1. limiting
    2. decentralizing

    - governmental power
    - but there is also a *constructive* reason
    - great advances in civilization have *never* come from centralized government
    - not one of the pushes humanity's frontier of knowledge was in response to governmental directives
    - they were the product of individual genius
    - of strongly held minority views
    - of social climate permitting variety and versity

  - the book's major theme is competitive capitalism (private enterprise operating in free markets)
  - the book's minor theme is government's role in a free society (relying on the market)
  - the right label for this is liberalism

  - in 1930, liberalism came to be associated with a very different emphasis
    - 19th century liberalism thought
      - freedom drives welfare and quality
    - 20th century liberalism thought
      - welfare and equality drives freedom
      - catchwords became welfare and quality, rather than freedom

  - conservatism isn't a good label for these sets of values
    - the 19th century liberal *was* radical
    - so too must be his modern heir
    - as the views aren't accepted yet
    - and for some reason, the buden of proof still remains
    - the 19th century liberal does *not* wish to *conserve* the state interventions
    - interventions that have interfered so greatly with our freedom
    - liberalism in the book refers to 19th century liberalism
    - that is, the doctrines pertaining to a free man





1 - THE RELATION BETWEEN ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND POLITICAL FREEDOM
  - the thesis of the chapter: there is an intimate connection between economics and politics
    - a society which is socialist cannot also be democratic
    - in the sense of guaranteeing individual freedom

  - economic arrangements play a dual role in the promotion of free society
    1. economic freedom is an end in itself
    2. it's a means towards the achievement of political freedom

    - the first needs special emphasis
    - intellectuals have a strong bias, and contempt for the material aspects of life

    - the second
    - competitive capitalism promotes political freedom because
    - it separates economic power from political power
    - it enables the one to offset the other

  - capitalism is a neccesary condition for political freedom
  - but clearly not sufficient
    - in the 19th century, this got flipped
    - people thought political freedom --> economic freedom
    - welfare rather than freedom became the dominant note

  - the market
    - direct component of freedom
    - indirectly related to political freedom

    - it protects consumers from producers
    - producers from consmers
    - employees from employers
    - the market does this impersonally without centralized control
    - the existence of free market does not eliminate the need for government
    - we still need government to umpire
    - to enforce and interpret the rules of the game
    - but markets minimize government by greatly reducing the range of issues that must be decided via poltical means

  - freedom
    - in society, freedom has nothing to say on what a men *ought* to do
    - it leaves that problem for the individual to wrestle with
    - afterall, man produces his best work when his self interests align
    - the liberal conceives of men as imperfect beings

    - competitive capitalism solves freedom
    - it solves the problem of mass coordination without coercion
    - it does this via markets
    - markets are free private enterprise exchange
    - markets give the opportunity for two parties to both benefit from the tx
    - as long as the tx is *voluntary and informed*
    - thus, people satisfy their wants by producing goods/services for others
    - you benefit yourself by benefitting others
    - the enterprise is the ultimate unit in capitalism, not the household
    - it scales coordination better

    - it is this feature of markets that begets political freedom
    - markets disperse and distribute power away from centralized control
    - markets are decentralized
    - it distributes economic power
    - it uncouples economic power from political power

    - it's a mark of the political freedom in a capitalist society
    - that you can openly advocate and work for socialisma

      - radicalist movements in capitalist societes
      - usually funded and supported by few wealthy individuals
      - this is how the inequality of wealth preserves political freedom
      - this is seldom noted in the opposition of capitalism

      - freedom to advocate unpopular causes
      - does not require such advocacy without cost
      - it just requires the cost of advocating unpopular cost
      - is tolerable and *not* prohibitive

    - thus, impersonal markets separate
    - economic activities from political views
    - it protects the individual from discrimination

    - the opposition of capitalism
    - instead of recognizing the existence of the market
    - has protected them from the attitudes of everyone
    - they mistakenly attribute the discrimination to the market itself





2 - THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN A FREE SOCIETY
  - a common objection totalitarian societies
  - they regard the end as justifying the means
  - any end that can be attained only by the use of bad means
  - must *give way* to the more basic end of the use of acceptable means

  - to the liberal the appropriate means are
    - free discussion
    - voluntary cooperation
  - this implies that any form of coercion is innappropriate
  - with this standpoint
    - the role of the market permits unanimity *without* conformity
    - otoh, action through explicit political channels tends to
    - require or enforce *substantial* conformity

  - there are clearly some matters to which proportional representation is *impossible*
    - i cannot get the amount of national defense i want and you, a different amount
    - with respect to such individual matters, we can discuss, argue, and vote
    - but having decided, we *must conform*

  - it is precisely the existence of indivisble matters:
    - protection of the individual
    - protection of the nation (from coercion)
    - are clearly the *most basic*
  - that prevents *exclusive* reliance on individual action through the *market*
  - if we are to use some of our resources for such indivisible items
  - we must employ *political* channels to reconcile differences

  - fundamental differences in basic values
    - can seldom ife ver be resolved at the ballot box
    - ultimately, they can only be decided, though *not* resolved
    - by conflict
    - the religious and civil wars of history are bloody testament to this judgement

  - the widespread use of the market reduces the strain on the social fabric
    - by rendering conformity *unnecessary*
    - the wider range of activities covered by the market,
    - the *fewer* issues that must be decided via explicit political means

  - unanimity is of course an ideal
    - in practice, we can afford neither the time nor the effort
    - we are thus led to accept majority rule
    - if the matter is of little moment, and the minority has *no* strong feelings, a bare plurality will suffice
    - otoh, if the minority feels *strongly* about the issue
    - even a bare majority will *not* do
    - some principles are so important that we are willing to make minimal concessions to expediency

    - essential consensus was achived *initially* in accepting them
    - we require something like essential consensus for a *change* in them

  - we now turn to areas that *cannot* be handled through the market at all
    - or can be handled only at so great a cost,
    - that the use of political channels may be preferable

  

  government as a rule-maker and umpire
    - we cannot rely on custom or on consensus alone to
      - interpret
      - and to enforce the rules
    - we need an *umpire*
    - the need for government in these respects arises
    - bc absolute freedom is *impossible*
    - however attractive anarchy may be as philosophy
    - it's not feasible in a world of imperfect men

    - men's freedoms can conflict, and when they do,
    - one's man freedom is limited to preserve another's
    - "my freedom to move my fist must be limited by the proximity of your chin"

  action through government on technical monopolies and neighborhood effects
    - the role of the government is to do something that the market cannot do for itself
    - namely, to determine, arbitrate, and enforce the *rules of the game*
    - we may also want to do through government
      - things that may be *conceivably* be done through the market
      - but that technical or similar conditions render it difficult

    - these reduces to cases in which voluntary exchange is either
      - exceedingly costly or
      - practically impossible

    - there are two general cases of this
      1. monopoly
      2. neighborhood effects

    - monopoly
      - implies the absense of alternatives
      - inhibits freedom of exchange
      - naturally arises from government support or
      - collusive agreements among individuals
      - may also arise because it is technically efficient, to have a single producer or enterprise
        - such cases are more limited however
      - out of all three
        - public monopoly
        - private monopoly
        - public regulation
      - private monopoly seems to be the lesser of all evils

    - neighborhood effects
      - strictly voluntary exchange being impossible
      - can happen when actions of individuals have affects on other individuals
      - for which it is *not* feasible to *charge* or *commpense* them
      - obvious example: a pollution of a stream

  action through government on paternalistic grounds
    - freedom is a tenable objective only for *responsible individuals*
    - we do *not* believe in freedom for madmen or children
    - the clearest case is a madmen
    - children offer a more difficult case
      - the ultimate objectivee unit in our society is the family, *not* the individual
      - children are at one and the same time consumer goods and potentially
      - responsible members of society
    - there is no formulua that can tell us where to stop
      - we must rely on our fallible judgement
      - our ability to persuade our fellow men
      - or their ability to persuade us to modify our views
      - we must put our faith in a consensus reached by imperfeect and biased men
      - through free discussion and trial and error

  conclusion
    - the consistent liberal is *not* anarchist
    - some activities currently undertaken by government in the US
    - that cannot be justified in terms of the principles above

    1. parity price *support* for agriculture
    2. *tariffs on imports* or *restrictions on exports*
    3. government *control of output*
    4. *rent control* (new york)
    5. legal *minimum* wages, or legal *maximum* prices
    6. detailed *regulation* of industries
    7. violation of *free speech* (radio/tv)
    8. *social* security programs
    9. licenses which restrict particular enterprises/people
    10. public housings or other *subsidy* programs
    11. *conscription*
    12. *national parks*
    13. legally prohibition on the carrying of mail for profit
    14. publicly owned and operated toll roads

    - this list is far from extensive





3 - THE CONTROL OF MONEY
  - full employment, price stability, and economic growth
    - are excuses for widening government intervention in economic affairs
    - "the government must step in and keep things on an even keel"
    - these arguments were particularly potent during and after the great depression
    - the government cites problems with inelastic money
    - usually, these are actual problems of elastic money
    - Keynesian economics might have had the incentive in 1900s to outspend Communism
    - is it sustainable long-term though?
    - we will find out in the 21st century
    - opposition: russia/china
  
  - rules instead of authorities
    - we can't achieve our goals via
      - automatic gold standard or
      - wide discretion to independant authorities
    - how else can we establish a monetary system that is
      - stable
      - and free from irresponsible government *tinkering*

    - government law
      - the legislation of *rules* for the conduct of monetary policy
      - has the effect of the public to exercise cntrol over monetary policy
      - via political authorities
      - BUT, at the same time
      - it will prevent monetary policy from being subject
      - to the day-to-day whim of political authorities

    - re: discourse on fundamental legislation
      - discourse sometimes needs to be at the abstraction, rather than specifics
      - abstract level makes people feel much more strongly about being deprived of their right to frree speech
      - when they are in the minority
      - more than what he would feel when talking about
      - depriving someone else of th right to free speech, when he is in the majority

      - when discussion is in the abstract,
      - a person will give more weight to the infrequent denial of free speech to himself

      - when the bundle is viewed as a whole
      - there is cumulative effects
      - the whole is greater than the sum of its parts


  - conclusion
    - legislated rule of monetary authority
      - to achieve a specified rate of growth
      - in the *stock of money*
      - defined as current outside commercial banks + deposits







CONCLUSION
  - in the 1920s and 1930s, intellectuals in the USA were persuaded
    - that capitalism was a defective system
    - the attitudes of that time are still with us
    - still a tendency to regard any existing government intervention as desirable
    - and to attribute all evils to the market
    - the proponents of limited government and free enterprise are still on the *defensive*
  
  - all of humanity's progress thus far
    - has been the product of individuals cooperating *through* the free market
    - government measures have *hampered* *not* *helped* this development
    - the strongest and most creative forces known to man
    - is to promote their *own interests*
    - and to live their lives by their *own values*
    - this is one of the major strengths of a free society

  - people who centralize want quick change
    - free institutions may perhaps offer a slower route to the ends they seek
    - but it will be surer, and definitely free
