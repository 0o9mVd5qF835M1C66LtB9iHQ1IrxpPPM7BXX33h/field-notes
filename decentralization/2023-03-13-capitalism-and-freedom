capitalism and freedom (1962)
=============================

INTRODUCTION
  - president kennedy said
    - ask not what your country can do for you,
    - ask what you can do for your country
    - the free man will ask neither of those questions
    - the free man asks "what can i and my compatriots do *though* government
      - to help us discharge our individual responsibilities
      - to achieve our several goals and purposes
      - and above all, preserve freedom
    - he will also acompany the question with another
    - "how can we keep the government we create from becoming a frankenstein
      - a frankeinstein that will destroy the very freedom we establish it to protect?"

  - even though med who wield power intially are ones of goodwill
    - and even though they be not corrupted by the power they exercise
    - the power will both attract and form men of a *different stamp*
    - how do we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the threat to freedom?
    - through two broad principles emboded in our constitution give the answer
    - it has preserved our freedom so far, but also violated repeatedly in practice

  1. the scope of government must be *limited*
    - it's major function should be to protect our freedom
    - both from enemies on the ouside
    - and from our fellow citizens on the inside

  2. government power should be *dispersed*
    - essentially a free market, creating competition for community
    - where one lives

  - people think centralization will enable change more effectively
    - in a sense they are right, but miss the forest for the trees
    - the power to do good is also the power to do harm
    - they are two sides of the same coin
    - the great tragedy of the drive to centralization
    - and the drive to expand scope of government
    - is mostly led by men of goodwill
    - but will be the first to rue its consequences

  - the preservation of freedom is the protective reason for
    1. limiting
    2. decentralizing

    - governmental power
    - but there is also a *constructive* reason
    - great advances in civilization have *never* come from centralized government
    - not one of the pushes humanity's frontier of knowledge was in response to governmental directives
    - they were the product of individual genius
    - of strongly held minority views
    - of social climate permitting variety and versity

  - the book's major theme is competitive capitalism (private enterprise operating in free markets)
  - the book's minor theme is government's role in a free society (relying on the market)
  - the right label for this is liberalism

  - in 1930, liberalism came to be associated with a very different emphasis
    - 19th century liberalism thought
      - freedom drives welfare and quality
    - 20th century liberalism thought
      - welfare and equality drives freedom
      - catchwords became welfare and quality, rather than freedom

  - conservatism isn't a good label for these sets of values
    - the 19th century liberal *was* radical
    - so too must be his modern heir
    - as the views aren't accepted yet
    - and for some reason, the buden of proof still remains
    - the 19th century liberal does *not* wish to *conserve* the state interventions
    - interventions that have interfered so greatly with our freedom
    - liberalism in the book refers to 19th century liberalism
    - that is, the doctrines pertaining to a free man


CONCLUSION
  - in the 1920s and 1930s, intellectuals in the USA were persuaded
    - that capitalism was a defective system
    - the attitudes of that time are still with us
    - still a tendency to regard any existing government intervention as desirable
    - and to attribute all evils to the market
    - the proponents of limited government and free enterprise are still on the *defensive*
  
  - all of humanity's progress thus far
    - has been the product of individuals cooperating *through* the free market
    - government measures have *hampered* *not* *helped* this development
    - the strongest and most creative forces known to man
    - is to promote their *own interests*
    - and to live their lives by their *own values*
    - this is one of the major strengths of a free society

  - people who centralize want quick change
    - free institutions may perhaps offer a slower route to the ends they seek
    - but it will be surer, and definitely free
