the sovereign indvidual (1997)
==============================

FOREWARD
  - easy to point out what they got wrong
  - they missed the rise of china
  - they got a lot right though
  - ai is trying to solve the "calculation problem"
    - an i could control an economy
  - cryptography otoh is solving the decentralized, individualized world

  - if ai is communist, crypto is libertarian
    - the future may lie between these poles
    - reading the sovereign individual in 2020 is prudent


1 - THE TRANSITION OF THE YEAR 2000
  - unlike the agriculture revolution, the information revolution will not take millenia to do its work
  - the information revolution will happen within a lifetime
  - also, the transformation will be universal, and happen almost everywhere at once

  - the coming revolution will liberate individuals as never before



2 - MEGAPOLITICAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE
  - somethine new is coming
  - western people thought of themselves as "modern"
    - only when they understood that the medieval period was over
    - before 1500, no one had ever thought of the feudal centuries as a "middle" period in western civilization
    - this makes sense: before an age can reasonably seen as sandwhiched in the "middle" of two other historic epochs
    - it must have already come to an end
    
  - there's a taboo on foresight
    - if you wish to understand the great transition now under way,
    - you have little choice bbut to figure it out for yourself
    - transitions that are undeniably real in retrospect, may not be ack'd for decades or even centuries after they happen
    - journalists may be partisan, they even be outrageously so
      - but they seldom report conclusions that would convince subscribers to cancel their subscriptions and run for the hills
      - it took many decades, even centuries, before the fall of rome was acknowledged
      - by the end of the fifth century, the emperors had been replaced by barbaric germanic kings
      - it was a time of "persistent make-believe"

  - "persistent make-believe"
    - it involved the preservation of the facade of the old system,
    - even as its essence was "deformed by barbarism"

  - so-what?
    - the point here is not why rome fell, or whether the world today faces the same risks
    - it's about the perception, or rather, misperception
    - you'll be invited at almost every turn to believe the coming information society will be similar to the industrial revolution
      - this comment seems to be for people reading the book, at the time
      - not so much for internet-natives like genz

  - grand-illusion
    - important transitions in human history are seldom driven primarily by human wishes
    - no forager ever said "I am tired of living in prehistoric times,
    - I would prefer the life of a peasant in a farming village"
    - for views to actually change that abruptly, it probably indicates:
    - humanity has been confronted by some departure from familiar conditions via external force
    - invasion, plague, sudden climatic shift, or a technological revolution
    - in essence, an external stimulus which triggers cahnge

  - incentives matter
    - violence is the *ultimate boundary force* on behavior
    - if you can understand how the logic of violence will change,
    - then you can usefully predict the future

    - megapolitical catalysts for change usually appear well before the consequences manifest themselves
    - it took 5000 years for the full implication of the agricultural revolution
    - agricultural -> industrial revolution though unfolded more quickly, only taking centuries
    - the transition to the information society will happen more rapidly still, probably within a lifetime

    - an early understanding of how the world will change is far more useful to you than it would have been to your ancestors
      - knowing  the full implications of agricultural revolution would have been practically useless
      - bc it 1000s of years to pass before the transition to the new phase of society was complete
      - this isn't the case today
      - history has sped up

  - megapolistics variables
    1. topography
    2. climate
    3. microbes
    4. technology





3 - EAST OF EDEN
  - the agricultural revolution
    - first great economic and social revolution
    - it was introduced in a "long incremental process"
    - "may have taken five thousand years or more"
  - it was a slow-motion revolution
    - transformed human life by altering the logic of violence
    - wherever farming took root, violence emerged as an important feature of social life
    - such a simple shift in the character of work,
    - radically alters the organization of society
  - understanding the agricultural revolution is the first important step to understanding the information revolution

  - anthropologists claim humans have been hunter-gatherers 99% of our time
    - to minimize overkill, hunting bands has to be small
    - groups number between 25 - 50 individuals
    - before farming, humsans were about as densely settled as bears
    - although some gatherers were fishers, most were hunters

    - hunter-gatherers had no technology to effectively store mea
    - foragers had little to steal
    - there was no incentive
    - also, bc they tended to roam in search of food, they have few belongings
    - very little property crime
    - this does not mean they were 100% peaceful
    - they might have employed violence for personal reasons, or even sport

  - overkill
    - with no reason to earn, and almost no concept of division of labor
    - there was no incentive to work hard
    - this virtue must have been foreign to hunter gatherers
    - there was nothing to be gained by working beyond the bare minimum required for survival
    - that meant working 8-15 hours a week
    
    - seen in this perspective, the advent of agriculture was more than just a change in diet
    - it also launched a great revolution in the organization of economic life and culture
    - and most importantly, the logic of violence
    - crops and domesticated animals were property
    - they could be stored, hoarded, and stolen

  - agriculture revolution
    - bc of property, this tended to increase size of societies
    - this is bc contests of violence were often won by the larger group
    - employment and slavery also arose for the first time
    - bc farming created assets to plunder and to protect
    - it also created a requirement for inventory accounting
    - the symbols employed in the accountant's ledger became the rudiments of written language

    - it aso created the idea of planning for the future
    - hunter-gatherers lived within time horizon
    - planting and harvesting crops took months
    - pursuing projects of longer time frame led farmers to train their attention to the stars
    - figuring out when to best plant and reap
    - almanacs, calendars, etc
    - astronomy in the agricultural revolution led the way for science during the industrail revolution

  - property
    - farming altered the logic of violence
    - farming incentivizes violence bc it created something to steal
    - the powerful were now able to organize a new form of prediation
    - a local monopoly on violence, or known today, as government
    
    - there was private property in the early agricultural societies,
    - but rarely at the bottom of the social pyramid
    - most peasants, up until modern times, were so poor
      - starvation was big risk from drought, flood, or infestation of crops
      - thus, peasants were forced to minimize risk
      - but this came at the expensve of foreclosing the opportunity to accumulate capital,
      - and rise in the economic system

  - peasant insurance
    - landlord absorbed part of the downside risk of a bad harvest
    - this also meant that the lanlord took the greater part of the potential profit
    - just like capitalist vs wage-earner today
    - this minimized the risk of starvation
    - most common organization of agricultural societies has historically been
    - fedaul, with maarket relations at the top, and the closed village system at the bottom

  - feudal revolution of the year 1000
    - aka the dark ages
    - the capacity of the kind and the courts to enforce order collapsed
    - anyone with armor and a horse could now become a law unto himself
    - feudalism was the response of agricultural society to the collapse of order at a time of low productivity

    - during the early stages of feudalism, the church played an important and economically productive role
      - it helped create rules, as only a religion could
      - it preserved and transmitted technical knowledge/innformation
      - it improved the productivity of european farming
      - it took care of public infrastructure

      - in the same way that military spending during the cold war helped the internet
      - the building of cathedrals led to the incubation of commerence
      - the church was an essential instution during the dark ages

  - vulternability to violence
    - the expulsion from the garden of eden can be seen as
    - the figurative account of the transformation of society from foraging to farming
    - from a free life with little work to life of hard labor

  - paradise lost
    - farming set humanity on an entirely new course
    - the first farmers truly planted the seeds of civilization
    - from their toil came
      - cities
      - armies
      - arithmetic
      - astronomy
      - dungeons
      - wine
      - whiskey
      - written word
      - kings
      - slavery
      - war


    - scholars indicate that eden is a sumerian word for "wilderness"
    - the memory of life before farming was that of paradise lost





4 - THE LAST DAYS OF POLITICS
  - parallels between the senile decline of the holy mother church and the nanny state
  - politics is mostly a modern invention, "we" believe it will end with the modern world
  - politics as a concept only dates back to the 1500s
  - politics emerged from the struggle to control the sharply increased spoils of war
  - politics began five centuries ago with the early stages of industrialism
  - now it is dying
  - as "we" write, there is little evidence of articulate rejection of politics
  - that will come later
  - it has not yet occured that a life without politics is possible
  
  - the last days of the holy mother church
    - the monolithic church as an instituion had grown senile and counterproductive
    - by the end of the 15th century, the church had become a major drag upon productivity
    - much the same thing can be said of the nation-state today

    - in a world with increased violence, the nation-state was a useful institution
  
  - the parallels between chivalry and citizenship
    - both served similar function
    - they facilitated the exercise of power
    - the medieval man was bound by oaths to individuals and the church,
    - much the same way that moderns are bound by citizenship to the nation-statate
    - violating an oath was the medival equivalent of treason
    - the heads of state must convince individuals that
    - upholding duties to the lord/nation-stat are more important than life itself
    - it justified and rationalized everyone's obligation that bound everyone
    - the history of the middle ages is filled with examples of prominent people fulfilling pledges,
    - that seem ridiculous to us
    - we believe that people in the future who look back at the era of the nation-state
    - will find some of the undertakings done in the name of citizenship
    - as ludicrous as we consider self-flagellation
    - citizenship crucially depended on the fact that
    - no individual or sall group of individuals was megapolitically capable of exercising military power independantly

  - people in the late middle ages thought before all else of status
    - they were ill-prepared to comprehhend that
    - merchants could possibly contribute anything of importantance
    - merchants were comoners, below the three estates
    - below the nobility and the clergy

  - the birth of the industrial age
    - the first industrial technology was the printing press
    - it was the first machine of mass production
    - it was the signature technology that marked the onset of industrialism
    - bc of specialized technology and division of labor, each employee could make 4800 times more than an individual
    - first time humanity had leverage

    - printing lowered the cost of knowledge
    - printing rapidly undermined the church's monopoly on the word of god
    - church attempting to surpress the printing press is akin to
    - the US government supressing encryption technology
    - printing press dramatically lowered the costs of reproducing information
    - in the middle ages, manuscripts were duplicated by hand
    - this was an extremely costly undertaking
    - what was done in months could be done in hours by the printing press
    - before mass literacy, most people were illiterate
    - a symbolic mode of thinking not only complemented a hierarchic structure of society
    - it also suited illiteracy
    - in contrast, the advent of printing led to the development of
    - causal reasoning, and the scientific method

    - the advantage of holding land as compared to money capital was falling
    - yet the medieval mind continued to think in terms of a status-bound society,
    - where social position wass determined by *who* you were, rahter than by your skill deploying capital effectively

  - downsizing the church
    - by the end of the 15th century, the church was not only as corrupt as the nation-state today,
    - it was also a major drag on economic growth

    1. direct costs such as tithes, taxes, and fees
    2. religious doctrines made saving diffcult
    3. idealogy spending capital to acquire relics
    4. the church bending law in its own interests
    5. the idealogical opposition of the medival church to capitalism
    
    - people minded less, the fact of giving money to the church when there was *no other outlet for it*
    - but when ppl saw the chance to make 100x returns on their capital
      - spice voyage to the east
      - financing a battalion for the kind
    - they were less interested in the church
    - the weakening of the church's monopoly led to sharp reduction in income redistribution
    - the peasants and urban poor who were not immediate beneficiaries of the new system were bitterly envious of those who did
    - hatred of rich people, especially the new rich





5 - THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE NATION-STATE
  - the rubble of history
    - berlin wall is the most important pile of historical rubble,
    - since the walls of giovanni were blasted 5 centuries earlier in 1495
    - the destruction of the berlin wall marks another historical moment
    - the passage between the industrial age and the new information age

  - voice vs exit
    - more and more people identify less with the nation-state
    - almost half of teens said they expected to leave the country of their birth in pursuit of their goals
    - bill clinton proposed the enactment of an exit tax, making americans pay a substantial ransom to escape
    - when failing systems have the power to do so, they often impose  penal burdens upon those seeking to escape
    - the question of whether to escape is known as the ultimum refugium in latin
    
    - the US stance on people leaving is less logical than other countries
    - it does not have a large economic investment in people who seek to flee (at least now)
    - it's not a question of being educated at state expense and leaving
    - those people have created wealth by their own efforts- in spite of, not because of, the us government

    - 1% of tax payers pay 30% of the total income tax
    - those who pay most of the bills pay vastly more than the value of any benefits they receive
    - the stability and even the survival of western welfare states depends upon their ability to
    - contine extracting a huge fraction of the world's total output
    - for redistribution to a subset of voters in the OECD countries

  - life and death of nation-state
    - the fall of the berlin wall marked the defeat of nation-states,
    - and the triumph of efficiency and markets
    - nation states lasted for two hundred years, starting w the french revolution
    - before the french revolution, nation-states only accounted for a small fraction of sovereignties
    - in terms of the industrial age, both communism and capitalism were indeed great opposites
    - but from the perspective of the information age, they are fraternal twins
    - both facilitate *unimpeded* control of resources via government
    - the only difference is that the west allowed individuals to own property and accumulate wealth
    - then, after the wealth had been accumulated, the nation-state taxed a large portion of it away
    - the fall of communism and the berlin wall was like the death of a fraternal twin

  - who controls the government?
    - there are 3 basic alternatives in the control of government
      1. proprietors
      2. employees
      3. customers

    - proprietors
      - usually a hereditary leader
      - owns the country
      - more common among lords of the middle ages
    
    - employees
      - they have little interest in minimizing the amounts exacted for protection
      - and *none* in minimizing that large part of costs represented by labor costs (their own salaries)
      - maximizing size was more to their taste
      - their incentives are toward chronic deficits
      - governments controlled by proprietors wouldn't be

    - customers
      - example is like medieval merchant republics (venice)
      - customers genuinely paid for the service
      - another example is american republic in its founding period
      - at the time, only those who paid for the government, were allowed to vote
      - governments controlled by customers, like those of proprietors, have incentives to reduce operating costs
      - but unlike proprietors and employees, they have incentives to *hold down* the prices
    
  - the role of democracy (voters as employees and customers
    - contemporary government is *not* controlled by its customers
    - contemporary political culture would find it outrageous if it was so
    - imagine the uproar if a us president proposed to allow the group of citizens who pay the majority of taxes,
    - to determine which programs of government should continue and which groups of employees should be fired

    - when you think about it, it's outrageous that it's not the case
    - customers are in the driver seat, they should get what they want
    - in reality, most democracies run chronic deficits
    - this is a fiscal policy characteristic of control by employees
    - progressive income taxation, which emerged in every democratic welfare state during the course of the 20th century
    - is dramatically unlike pricing provisions that would be preferred by customers
    - customers would scream blood murder if charged $50k on a $120k deal made through the phone
    - but that is the basis upon which income taxes are assesed in every democratic welfare state
    - democratic welfare states are governments controlled by employees

    - this is bc when returns to violence are high and rising
    - magnitude is more important than efficiency
    - this means governments controlled by customers *cannot* prevail
    - and often, cannot survive
    - the entities most effective militarily are those that comandeer the most resources for war
    - the west was simply the winners of the spending contest during the cold war
    - government aim is not to create the most efficient economy
    - it is to extract the most resources, and channel them into military
    - democracy combined the efficiency of private ownership and
      - incentives for the creation of wealth with
      - a mechanism to facilitate essentially unchecked accesst to that wealth
      - aka taxing
    - customers could never dominate
      - this is bc internal freedom is inversely correlated with external danger
      - mass democracy may prove to be an anachronism that will not survive

  - industrialism and democracy
    - it's easy to see why governments were more successful in extracting resources
    - when they dealt with millions of citizens
    - rather than a relative handful of lords, dukes, earls, bishops, etc
    - small sums taken in taxes from millions could more revenue than larger amounts paid by a few powerful people
    - one example of a customer ran by customers failing is poland
    - king could not extract wealth from the people, and eventually poland ceased to exist as a country
    - with democratic decision-making, the nation-state could exercise power much more completely over millions of people

    - who could not easily cooperate to act collectively in their own behalf
    - democracy alloweeed the state to tap the resources of the well-to-do
    - without having to bargain directly for their permission
    - this could happen at a time when magnitude of force was more important than efficiency

  - to summarize, the democratic nation-state succeeded during the past two centuries for hidden reasons:
    1.  rising returns to violence, magnitude of force more important than efficiency
    2. incomes rose sufficiently, allowed state to collect large amounts without habign to negotiate
    3. democracy was controlled by employees, making it difficult to curtail expenditures
    4. an effective antitode to the ability of the wealthy to act in to restrict the nation-state's ability to tax

    - democracy became the militarily winning strategy because it facilitated the gathering of more resources into the hands of the statee

  - nationalism
    - natiaonlism was a corollary of mass democracy
    - like politics, nationalism is mostly a modern invention
    - nationalism tended to lower the cost of controlling larger areas
    - before nationalism, early-modern state required the help of
      - lords, dukes, earls, bishops, etc
    - nationalism decisively lowered the costs of mobilizing military personal
    - by encouraging group identification with the interests of the state
    - harnessing group feeling to the interests of the state
    - even the soviet union converged on nationalism as a complementary ideology

    - nationalism came into play just prior to the gunpower revolution
    - it first became important though during the french revolution
    
  - the information age will require new mechanisms of representation to avoid chronic dysfunction and even social collapse





6 - THE MEGAPOLITICS OF THE INFORMATION AGE
  - extortion and protection
    - technology has tipped the balance toward protection, rather than exortion
    - information technology dramatically alters the balance between protection and extortion
    - technology makes the protection of assets much easier, and extortion more difficult
    - these algorithms will allow the creation of a new, protected realm of cybercommerence
    - the leverage of violence will be greatly reduced
    - the balance between extortion and protection will tip dramatically in the direction of protection
    - and remember, when the logic of violence changes, socety changes




  - the logic of violence
  - exploitation of the capitalists by the workers
  - deciphering the logic of extortion

  - the law of the telecosm repeals the law of nations
    - access creates globalism
    - globalism disrupts political systems by making the concept of borders obsolete
    - as borders disappear, the concept of taxation, which supports governments, becomes increasingly fragile
    - the idea of nationhood also falls apart
    - on the horizon waits a much purer form of individualism than democracy as we now understand it
    - the simple fact is that patriotism is not useful any longer
    - citizens will now identify themselves globally (virtually)
    - the devaluation of physical borders is implied by the tripling of bandwidth
    - single fiber stand, as thin as human hair, can carry one trillion bits per second
    - the capacity for expansion is stupefying
    - dedicated telephony and television will become anachronisms (twitter space)
    - as the bandwidth revolution unfolds, it will draw more and more people into the bordless virtual world of
    - online communities and cybercommerce
    - aka the metaverse
    - as more economic activity is drawn into cyberspace,
    - the value of the state's monopoly power within borders will shrink
    - just as nation state's today have incentives to host free ports, free-trade zones, and zona francasS
    - they will also have incentivez to lease their sovereignty
    - just like elsavador
    - sea travel had implications on our cities, and so will the internet

  - the evolution of protection
    - Lane discerned four important stages in the functioning economies over the past thousand years
    - each involve a different phase in the organization of violence
    1. out of the dark ages
    2. feudalism
    3. the early-modern period
    4. the factory age

    - lane essentially views governments as companies selling protection against and usage of, violence
    - governments in the industrial age enjoyed a delightful monopoly to exploit
      - their actual costs fopr providing protection of life and limb were extremely small
      - compared to the prices (taxes) they charged
      - there was no competition
      - they could plunder more than protect, and have that fact go unnoticed
      - it was a rare moment in history
      - no matter what portion of taxes was plunder,
      - they were a price one had to pay to "avoid more severe losses"
      - this is bc anarchy was infeasible
      - e.g. collecting an income tax at the factory was far simpler than fanning out over the countryside,
      - and collection taxes from millions of independants


    - the information age is bringing a fifth stage in the evolution of competition in the use of violence, in the west
    - it involves competition in the cyberspace,
    - an arena not subject to monopolization by any "violence-using enterprise"
    - governments never estalibshed stable monopolies of coerecion over the open sea
    - the cyberspace has no physical existence at all
    - it will be less likely the government could succesfully monopolize an infinte realm without physical boundaries

  - competition without anarchy
    - for the first time in history,
    - information technology allows for the creation and protection
    - of assets that lie entirely outside the realm of any government's territorial monopoly on violence
    - thus, residents will now have a choice in deciding whose laws they are to obey
    - unlike the medieval frontier socities,
    - the cyberspace will not be duopolistic
    - there will be hundreds of authorities throughout the globe
    - sovereignty will be commercialized
    - the competition that information technology is driving
    - is not competition of a miltarty kind, but one in quality and price of economic service
    - this is genuine protection
    - governments will be obliged to give customers what they want





  - superpowers of virtual warfare
    - the nation-state will make less and less sense as the importance of information in warfare increases
    - the sovereign individual may count for as much in cyberspace as does a nation-state
    - a hacker, or a small group of mathematicians, or any company like microsoft could in principle
    - do any or all of the things that the petengon's cyber war task force has up its sleeves
    - hundreds of firms in the valley have greater capacity to wage a cyberwar than 90% of the existing nation-states

    - the nation-states must be reconfigured to reduce their vulnerability to
      - computer viruses
      - logic bombs
      - infected writes
      - trapdoor programs
    - the megapolitical logic of cyberspace suggests that the central command-and-control systems that currently dominate
    - will be replaced by distributed systems
    - unlike central planners, the new systems controlled by algorithms will mock market mechanisms
    - to allocate resources more efficiently
    - the information age is more efficient than democracy/capitalism

  - this will create intense competition to price government's services (the taxes it charges) on a
  - nonmonopolisti basis
  - this is revolutionary





7 - TRANSCENDING LOCALITY
  - the internet calls into question the very idea of a nation state
  - the information economy is *not* like a highway, railroad, or pipeline
  - it is *not* merely a transit link, it *is* the destination
  - cyberspace *transcends* locality

  - cyberspace will not only alter the logic of violence
  - it will also radically alter information and transaction costs
  - this determines how businesses organize
  - microprocessing could change the economic organization of the world

  - the tyranny of place
    - even when technology enables us to transcend locality
    - we still nickname the tech, describing it as a route from place to place
    - the notions of locality are still etched into our conscious
    - for the entirety of history, economies have been *tethered* to local geogrphic area
    
    - everyone thinks that colonists came from europe seeking freedom and opportunity
    - that is true
    - but what is seldom told, is how reluctant people were to take the trip
    - even when faced with destitution at home
    - the few who did migrate suffered uninmaginable ordeals to establish themselves
    - only the most *enterprising* or most *desperate* of the poor came
    - in 1720 there were riots in the streets of paris
    - to free criminals scheduled for deportation to louisiana
    - this shit just like the show 100

  - all politics is local
    - the immobility of people and their assets has informed the way we see the world
    - the power advantages that give local monopolies on violence has always originated locally
    - this has faded along the megapolitical margins where borders are drawn
    - this is why there has *never* been a world government
      - unless aliens next week
  
  - the error of minimal expectations
    - not all technical people study history
    - thomas edison's lamp: "unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men"
    - wright brothers flight: "no possible combination of known substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of force, can be united in a practical machine by which me nshall fly long distances through the air"
    - commercial travel: "no hope of competing for racing speed with either our locomotives or our automobiles"
    - mercedes: "there will never be more than a million automobiles worldwide"

  - beyond locality
    - in the information age, ideas can be formulated anywhere and transmitted globally at the speed of light
    - the information economy will be dramatically different from the economy of the factory age
    - the cybereconomy will evolve through several stages

    1. using the internet as an information medium to facilitate industrial-era transactions
    2. an intermediate stage of internet commerce will employ information technology in ways not possible in the industrial era
      - still function within the old instituional framework
      - employing national currencies
      - submitting to the jurisdiction of nation-states
    3. a more advanced stage, transitioning to a true cybereconomy
      - transactions will migrate outside the jurisdiction of the nation states
      - payment will be rendered in cybercurrency
      - profits booked in cyberbanks
      - investments made in cyberbrokerages

  - the globalization of commerce
    - new advantages will emerge
    - falling communication costs have already reduced the need for proximity as a necessary condition of doing business

  - the devaluation of compulsion
    - encryption will make it easy to protect transactions in cyberspace
    - protection, the most important service governments provide,
    - will be put on a more competitive basis
  
  - the death of seigniorage
    - governments will not only lose their power to tax many forms of income and capital
    - they are also destined to lose pwoer of compulsion over money
    - the greatest revolution in money prior to the information age came with the advent of industrialism
    - the first implementation of mass production, the printing press, was actually used by governments
    - that is, the mass production of paper money
    
    - paper money is a distinctly industrial product
    - monks would not have spent their time drawing fifty pound notes
    - paper money also contributed significantly to the power of the state
    - it gives the state leverage over *who* can accumulate wealth

  - cybercash
    - when sovereign individuals can deal across borders in a realm with no physical reality,
    - they will no longer need to tolerate the degradation of the value of money via inflation
  
  - eradicating inflation
    - the most momentous consequence of digital money would be the end of inflation
    - thinking of inflation as a transaction fee for the convenience of holding the currency might be an unusual way of thinking, but consider it closely
    - argentina's hyperinflated currency is a leading indicator for the next millenium
    - the use of a new monetary system will therefore probably involve a more explicit transaction cost
    - perhaps a fee on the order of 1% per annum
    - this will be a small price to pay compared to the annual inflationary penalty which ranges from 3%-99% via nation states

    - since digital money will be beyond the power of any government to regulate
    - governments will lose a major part of their indirect capacity to comandeer resources




















AFTERWORD
  - devolution and the law of diminishing marginal returns

  - history of human societies
    - they tend to evolve towards *greater* complexity and control
    - hunter gatherers evolved into agriculture states which gave way to lager nation-states
    - the information age is the fourth turning, and will start the reverse

  - when hypertrophied systems have exhausted their potential
    - then the law of diminishing marginal returns sets in
    - we see this today, as the old instutions of social control (law/school/police)
    - they have lost effectiveness, despite their massive power and money
    - e.g. total tax 27.8% of us median income -> 37.6% from 1957 to 1997
    - this is a strong hint, if not absolute proof, of diminishing marginal returns of government activity in usa


  - in the past, sharply diminishing returns has been a prelude to *collapse*
    - collapse is what happens when a centralized control system is no longer *worth*, what it *costs*
    - the marginal returns from further investment in centralized control can become so negative
    - that it's no longer economically rational for most individuals to support the old system
    - e.g. in rome, there were simply no remaining benefits to the empire
      - the net value of local autonomy exceeded that of membership in the empire
      - both barbarians and tax collectors crossed, and ravaged the people's land
  - complexity was no longer yielding *benefits* superior to *disintegration*

  
  - threshold
    - these systems are vulnerable to radical change
    - this radical change can be precipitated by a single individual
    - this is bc the system has reached *threshold* condition

    - this individual can be *any*, they do not need to be exceptional
    - this is bc the system is analagous to a physical system
      - at any point of instability,
      - an accidental displacement of *any* one of the trillions of *idential* molecules precipitates a finite transition to a stable state

    - prophet
      - we cannot specify who or when the collapse will happen
      - we can simply see forsee collapse coming

  - 1% of americans pay the majority of income tax
    - these are precisely the people who efficient *microsovereignnties*,
    - can offer new opportunities for domicile at negligible cost in taxes
  
  - "out of all 36 ways to get out of trouble, the best way is to leave"
    - chinese proverb
    - aka voice vs exit
    - aka balaji
    - the argument of this book clearly informs the decision to redeploy your capital
    - you should never leave money in any jurisdiction that claiims the right to conscriptionn

    - to optimize wealth:
      - aim to reside in a country other than that from which you hold your first passport
      - keep the bulk of your money in a third durisdiction, preferably a tax haven
      - travel widely to acquaint yourself with alternatives you may want to secure the right to reside during emergency
      - if you're ambitious, you may even wish to carve out a minisovereignity of your own

    - if you agree with the premise of this book but lack the capital to deploy
      - your main priority should be to read and study
