steve keen: marxism, capitalism, economics

schools of thought
- physiocrats: value is extracted from the sun and soil
- classical: value is labor
- neoclassical: value is preferences
- keynes: chaos and stability, you can't assign value to apples/oranges
- austrian: ?

modern monetary theory
- is accounting, double entry book keeping
- money
    - money is a creator of accounting, not commodity
    - money is a claim on someone else
    - money is a liability of the banking sector
    - money is created via *bank loans*
    - for the government
        - deficits means more money in the banks of the private sector 
        - more welfare, social spending than taxing
        - money is created via *reserves*

money creation ethics
    - money creation is a good thing because it allows commerce to happen
    - commerce is the activity of buying and selling, especially on a large scale

sum of total assets + total liabilities = 0
- mortgage
    - your liability + banks asset = 0
- money is the bank's liability, but the people's asset
    - the bank account is liability of the bank account, and the cash is the liability of the federal reserve
    - what is money? money is the promise of a third-party that two parties accept, to close a transaction
- a monetary transaction in a capitalistic society has 3 agents
    - the buyer
    - the seller
    - the bank
    - a monetary transaction is essentially exchanging the bank's liability: money

karl marx
- his philosophy is: critical examination towards everything existing
- he wanted to understand and critize everything
- marx argued labor is the only source of value
    - he doesn't think machinery adds value

- karl talks about foreground and background
- there is a unity that exists in society
    - can be an individual, a group, a commodity
    - a human can be an object
    - the focus on the human being is the *capacity to work*
    - the fact that you're human, want to go surfing, make love, etc
    - but that gets put in the background
    - there is a tension between the foreground and background
    - a tension between what society wants and what the animal wants
    - back in hunter gatherer, there is no social hierarchy
        - there are no laborers, no capitalists
        - you're just a human
        - you have a more integrated view of who you are
        - you get treated for the *whole* of who you are
    - humans in complex society like capitalism
        - one part of you is emphasized (foreground)
        - another is de-emphasized (background)
    - when karl's analysis is applied to humans, the foreground is the machine of capitalism, background is fundamental humanity
- karl took the question and applied it to society
- what is the essential unity in a capitalist society? --> a commodity
    - essential unity is an object in society
    - a commodity is a unity in a capitalis society
    - he started from trying to understand how an exchange occurs
        - how do we set prices?
    - the foreground of a commodity is its exchange value (subjective)
    - the background of a commodity is utility (objective)

- feudal society vs capitalistic society
    - in a feudal society, the foreground (subjective desire) is valued higher (back scratcher made out of gold and diamonds)
    - in a capitalistic socieety, the background (objective utility) is valued higher ($2 back scratcher)

- when there is an exchange going on
    - the price will change until such time where the ratio of the marginal utility == the ratio of marginal cost (neoclassical)
    - marx says that is bullshit
    - marx says utility doesn't matter.
        - classical: utility is objective
        - neoclassical: utility is subjective
    - marx uses this idea (???) to explain where profit comes from
        - but he made a mistake
    - a worker's labor has an exchange value (use-value)
        - the buyer is the capitalist
        - the seller is the worker
        - the foreground is what the buyer pays for the labor (exchange value)
        - the background is what the buyer does with it (the utility)
        - karl treated worker as a raw commodity
        - profit is the difference between exchange value and use-value
        - does karl think of workers as humans?
    - the next layer up considers the human and their soul
        - a human is a commodity and a non-commodity
        - there is tension
        - when considering this layer, workers will demand more than their value
    - the basic idea: commodity is the basic unity of capitalism
        - the important commodity in marxist thinking is *the worker*
        - this leads to the labor theory of value

labor theory of value
- what is value?
    - neoclassical: subjective
    - marxist (classical): objective
- labor theory of value:
    - value comes (objectively) from labor
    - he misses: machines can bring value to the world
    - he only claimed human labor had value
- labor has both a commodity and commodity power
    - commodity: you can buy labor
    - commodity power: the ability to work in a factory
    - the difference is profit (surplus)
    - exclusivist argument: there is no other commodity that has both
- machine
    - the exchange-value and use-value can be applied to machines
    - machines can be used as a source of profit (surplus)
    - karl didn't think this, which led to the ideas of socialism
        - only humans could produce value, not machines

- both labor and machinery as a means to harness energy to harness work

marxian economics and marxist political ideology
    - the foundation of the political philosophu was the economic argument that there would be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall
    - the tendency for the rate of profit to fall would lead to capitalists trying to extract more surplus
    - the opposite of capitalism is socialism. the idea of socialism is that is treats human beings better
        - marx was preceeded by utopian socialists which said socialism *should* come about
        - marx wanted to prove that it *must* come about
        - that proof depended on the rate of profit to fall, and that relied upon labor being the *only* source of profit
    - the utopian view
        - each according to his ability, each according to his needs
        - you get what you need, not what you want
        - the vision was that all needs were fulfilled
        - fisherman in the morning, poet in the afternoon, chef at night
        - he thought human creativity did much better under socialism than capitalism
        - he was wrong?

socialism
- what is socialism?
    - loaded term
    - in american socialists is a large amount of provision of services by the state (commonplace in europe and australia)
    - american societies will call public education socialist
    - this definition is a parody of the word

    - public ownership of the means to production
        - machines, factories
        - the means of producing the goods is owned and planned by a central entity
        - the state owns your land
        - farmers don't own their own land
        - this was suppose to be utopia

- fascism is so called national socialism
    - there was public direction but private profit
    - the means to production wasn't controlled by *the state*, it was owned privately by a dictator
    - it's a particular implementation of socialism

- why did socialism fail?
