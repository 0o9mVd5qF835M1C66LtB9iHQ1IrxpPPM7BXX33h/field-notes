vitalik on starting new countries



ethereum
  - started end of 2013
  - travelling
  - people in israel were interested in what's next
  - what does a protocol look like to support those applications?
    - first protocol was color coins
    - second protocol was master coin- this was all pre-2013
    - balaji and vitalik met in 2013

    - at the time, he coined swiss-army knife protocols
    - supported 10 diffeent applications, but had one transaction type
    - he started poking, trying to collapse/merge three features into one
    - he started making small tweaks
    - maybe it makes sense for these contracts to be an account
    - send coins directly to a contract, just like a virtual agent
    - it first started on how to modify existing systems
    - ambition grew, and project became its own independant chain, ethereum



- what's your retro?
  - launch process blog post in 2015
  - frontier: launch of chain
    - very explicit marketing that iwas beta aka the frontier
  - homestead
    - somewhat out of the wild west
  - metropolis
    - ethereum foundation originally wanted to build a web browser
    - this does not happen, we have browser wallets



- balaji on dao
  - this is ancient history in crypto world
  - 7 years ago
  - people were checking on ethereum in 2016, valuation was $1B
  - this VC fund tried to be autonomous
  - from the outside, 10% of ETH was in the dao

  - this dao attacker read the code and could drain it
  - there was this white hat approach that could undo the black hat
  - they went back and forth until the final transaction, 30 day clock

  - he now has sympathy towards burnicke

- the other thing in 2016
  - equally as fascinating as the hack, but 10x fewer people have heard of it
  - sep 19, 2016
  - dao had gotten hacked months ago
  - dao hard fork happened two months ago
  - eth classic forked
    - whole bunch of people and exchanges supporting it
  - first time a crypto civil war existed
  - ethereum price just peaked
  - it just felt like the ethereum community was on its way out of the dao fiasco

  - but, then at 5:15am shanghai timein sep 19,
    - hotel devcon
    - military style wake up call
    - ethereum foundation calls him, tell him to come down
    - walked down to the room
    - 20 developers in the room
    - there was a bug, not in the protocol, but in implementations
    - computations were slower, took n^2 instead of n
    - a quadratic bug did happen in bitcoin
    - quadratic attack issue with hasing
    - one of those issues no one knows about

    - it was ok for bitcoin given block size
    - but block size increasing ==> more pain
    - influenced the block size discussion, slightly

    - in ethereum, the issue was in implementation detail
    - vitalik thinks the attacker might've done it purposely at the beginninng of defcon
    - patched bug before defcon
    - showed unity
    - core devs are the true heros of the ecosystem

    - when defcon finished
      - the attacker finished second, third, fourth attacks
      - literally in cyber war between geth/parity clients and the attacker
      - sometimes only geth worked, sometimes only parity, people had to switch back and forth


      - one month later, he found a bug with the protocol itself
      - self-destruct op code bug, makes ethereum state much bigger using tiny gas
      - had to do another emergency hard fork**

    - balaji remembers end of 2016, ethereum price dipped
      - folks thought smart contracts are just too hard
      - then, 3/4 months hard, things came back
    
- vitalik sent the tx that broke thereum consensus for the first and real time
  - then 2017 happened
  - then 2018
    - birth of uniswap
    - segueway into defi
  - then 2019
  - then 2020
    - defi summer
    - nfts
    - the one appllication vitalik didn't predict in the og white paper
  - then 2022
    - merge happened (serenity)
    - then added sharding, to scale



- balaji was concerned about the merge
  - moving the whole ecosystem over
  - the fact that was smooth and non-event, was really impressive
  - vitalik:
  - yes, transition took a lot of work
  - it was a surprise to the team as well that it was a non-event
  - every test broke
  - when the real merge happened, everything happened smoothely
  - changing the engine of a jet while it was flying

- now that the merge is done
  - the main thing that's left is sharding
  - we've talked about sharing for a long time, but it's gotten more ambitious
  - early versions of sharding were willing to give more trust (more than 50% were good-actors)
  - now it's more ambitious, can we prevent > 90% attacks?


  - 2020 trivia
    - well known in ethereum circles, but not outside
    - rollup-centric roadmaps
    - make some changes to ethereum to make L2 scaling solutions easier
    - L1 is like the supreme court, they don't see every case
    - rollup team wants to take off training wheels next year
      - backdoor if bugs happen
      - some teams will remove entirely, some will have hybrid
      - humans have half the votes, and the computers have half

  - 2023 will the year of rollups
    - training wheels are weakened alot
    - mostly trustless (not fully)
    - then sharding will be finished
    - after that, will be fully trustless, which will take a couple years later
    - after next year, first point vitalik would be happy with ethereum
    - but they don't want to stop there
    - ethereum can support 500M users before the next bull
    - transition from theory -> practical ecosystem





- what new country would you start, and why?
  - important to approach question not from LARPy pov
  - it's important to dig down into what is a country
  - break it up into its constituent parts
  - which of those parts and combination are valuable for people?

  - the serious version of the question: what is the single biggest problem that country can solve?

  - one of the ways to break a country
    - social network
    - legal and jurisdiction
    - possibly, third, physical location (climate)

    - even if you decide legal environment of dubai is perfect for you
      - problem with dubai
      - climate is being unfairly considered


    - the lives
    - the laws
    - and land


  - when balaji talks to people
    - they think about law and land immediately
    - but land and law are actually boundary conditions
    - they are the things that are mandatory or forbidden
    - you usually don't run into the law in everyday life
    - land is hard, but community you can get first

  
  - what's the difference between a city and country?
    - california is the only place in US which has a pleasant climate
    - plesant climate is inside 8 and 24
    - california beats every area
    - there's a huge tax to be in california
    - may contain traces
    - other con is cost
    - although the cons, still huge network effects


  - going back to starting a new country
    - first off, climate is very important
    - if you're starting a new X, you have to essentially create a network effect
    - there are ppl willing to pay the network effect penalty
      - they want a different network effect
      - they're willing to sacrifice quantity *for* quality

    - climate is one of two factors where you place yourself
    - other things, to add on climate, which are physical based
      - time zone
      - working in america is easier when working in argentia
      - rather than europe, although both are same distiance


    - basically, the question is
      - what is the benefit?
      - what are you willing to sacrifice?
      - a lot of people don't really have that much fancy stuff they need to do wrt law


  - balaji on climate
    - for a new country, the more desirable the land, the less disirable the land
    - more desirable means its more contentious
    - basically toronto vs chatham

  - 3000 people is enough
    - surprisingly small
    - but they all need to share interests
    - bc if not, it's way too boring
    - what do you get?
    - cost savings

- law
  - lots of people don't think of law
  - it's easy not to think of it
  - but, reality is moreso lord of the flies
  - crypto is for the powerless and the poweeruser
  - it's just the edges of the box
