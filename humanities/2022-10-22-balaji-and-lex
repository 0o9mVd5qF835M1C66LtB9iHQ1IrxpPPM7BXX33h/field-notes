- government
    - we can't easily and peacefully create opt-in governments
    - you can start a new company, new community, new currency in today's society. you can voice or exit
    - we want to build something new without historical constraint
    - the opposition to opt-in governments
        - tradition
            - new is good
            - going to the moon, and artificial intelligence is new
            - new has more upside, but less stability
    - we're seeing a v3
        - v1 hunter gatherer
        - v2 farmer/soldier
        - v3 new hunter gatherer, digital nomad (going back to the future)
    - 99.99% of political discourse focuses on fixing the current system
    - if .01% of the portfolio focusing on a new system seems like a decent investment strategy
- the network state
    - the network state is a highly aligned online community, with a capacity for collective action, tht crowdfunds territory across the world, and eventually gains diplomatic recongition from preexisting states
    - online communities tend to not be highly aligned
        - give to get, and build karma
        - capacity for collective action
            - need at least 1000 people to like a post to boost to society
            - if you have 970 people like a post, you have a laser
            - novelty vs tradition
            - novelty is like hackernews, box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get
            - hackernews doesn't have capacity for collective action
        - what is the discourse for a highly aligned community with collective action?
            - discord is the transitional state, but not the end
            - discord is chatty, but the work is done outside discord
            - makes sense, discord was born in the gaming world
    - difference between online communities, and the platforms in which those communities are formed
        - cave and commons
        - social networks are on the cave and commons continuum
        - twitter is all commons. maybe some DMs are caves
        - signal is all cave. completely private
        - polar ends of spectrum are easy to reason about
        - the middle is somewhat more complicated
        - facebook is the middle. it's quasi-private, you have to assume it's public
            - something can get screenshotted, and shared outside the private community
        - reddit, discord, slack are in the middle as well
- pseudonymous economy
    - anonym, pseudonym, real name is the spectrum
    - anonymous, 0 reputation tied to an identity
    - pseudonymous, repuation is tied to an identity
    - real name is social security number, state name, air tag, tracking device
        - all databases have a foreign key ref to real name
        - real name allows central state to perform joins across facebook, google, etc
    - pseudonym creates a whole separate node
    - finsta, rinsta
        - rinsta is the public-persona, meant to be search-indexed
        - finsta is private-persona, meant for friends
        - restoration of shade, the all seeing web crawler just "passes by you"
    - pseudonyms remove discrimination, and bring global equality of opportunity
    - before, statename surname was your profession
        - potter if you were a potter
        - smith if you were a blacksmith
        - programmable surname will tell something about you too
        - .eth, .sol, .btc, etc
        - very early in internet civilization
    - is there value of having of having permanent state name tied to your physical body?
        - how do we prevent people from commiting murder in society A, and then starting fresh in society B?
        - murder is illegal is most countries
        - countries have social contracts
            - if you violated, you wouldn't be allowed to leave
            - such a hollow abstraction?
    - the rule of a centralized state is perhaps more negative than positive
        - it's like nuclear energy, fire
        - the more trust you give it, the less trust it deserves
        - it's a weird feedback loop: the more trust, the more it can do. the more it can do, the more bad things it can do.
    - overcorrecting from centralization with too much decentralization yields to anarchy
        - new hitler
        - well, you always have an opt-out of the network state with exit
        - perhaps, in a way, hitler is more common in centralized states like today
- exit
    - voice: democracy and capitalism
    - exit: migration
    - you can vote with your wallet (capitalism), your ballot (democracy), or vote with your feet (migration)
    - wallet has some aspects of exit (store of value)
    - voting with your feet has some aspects of voice
    - voice vs exit is the dichotomy of: do you reform a system or exit it to build a new one or find an alternative?
    - given the mental model of voice vs exit, we can now classify technologies
        - internet has a bunch of instances of exit
        - internet gives microeconomic leverage via alternatives
            - uber vs lyft
            - tinder swiping
            - shop for better prices
            - illustrator vs DALLE
        - the individual is in power
    - you can customize your twitter experience
    - can you customize your USA experience?
        - your experience isn't configurable
- internet amplification
    - the internet amplifies microeconomic leverage
    - the internet also amplifies variance for any existing behavior
        - mockery, debates
        - true, bad stuff does happen, but on the other end of the distribution, people are also using the internet to find soulmates
        - the internet tears society apart, and it puts it back together
        - balaji says once we identify the positive side, we can amplify it to remove the bad
- advice for young people

        - most of your life will be spent in the matrix
            - (as i'm typing this it's absolutely beautiful outside but I'm here typing this shit)
            - in a constructed digital world
            - the physics is set by the programmers
            - physics is very important for the natural world
            - cs and stats is important for the digital world
            - every domain has algorithms and data structures
                - aviation
        - you have to understand the theory and practice
            - good exercise go from bernoulli trials to binomial distribution, to gaussian distribution, to geometric, etc
            - computer science is theory, software engineering is practice
            - probability and statistics is theory, data science is practice
            - it's ok to use libraries once you go under the hood
                - you can get quite far standing on the shoulder of giants, but you can't build a g/fb/aapl without someone at the company knowing computer architecture, layout memory, and compiler theory
                - libraries are just the APIs of the platform/runtime
        - there is such thing as "great man" that can push the tech tree in this rpg of life
            - satoshi nakamoto was truly the firt person to push the tech tree further. vitalik came five years after

        - you have genuine propery rights, this changes everything
        - like china getting property rights
        - might be some lag
    - build both a $1b dollar company (engineering) AND a million person media operation
    - just centralized tech/media in 2010s
    - centralized tech/media vs decentralized in 2020s
        - nyt, google, all wokeified
        - substack are decentralized (defactors)
        - andreeson, dorsey, zuck, brian, are cutting the media establishment and going direct
    - why is this important?
        - centralized media has lost a lot of clout
        - media engagement has crashed
        - some of the most evil people are historians
            - nyt was homophobic, then pro gay
            - nyt had slaves, and then they were against
            - they investigate your boss, but not their own
        - every influencer realizes, every media corporations are competitors
            - during 2010s, partially successfully, they would give influencers positive coverage if they supported the party line, and negative coverage if they didn't
    - once you realize
        - apple didn't collaborate blackberry
        - amazon didn't collaborate with barnes and nobles
        - netflix dind't collaborate blockbuster
        - they are your competitors

        - wall street with defi/eth
        - academia of chain of research
        - media

    - if you're an individual who's good at engineering, and good at content creation
        - jack dorsey
        - mark andreeson
        - jeff besos (on twitter)
        - if you have both, you can become president of a network state
        - it's a new path to political power, that does not require going through the chinese or american establish
        - don't need to wait until your 75

        - one of the biggest stories in the world that isn't being told much
            - india getting access to 5g, lte
            - majority of english speakers online in 2030 will be india
            - they've been lurking
            - (this makes sense, lots of my youtube comments are from india)
                - even balaji experienced this with his coursera course
            - these folks don't type with an accent
        - in the same way US was a branch of UK and started with english
            - nowadays most americans don't have english ancestry
            - germans, italians, jewish, african american
            - internet is more representative of the world than the USA is
            - hence, majority of english speakers in india
            - america got forked by the rest of the world via internet
            - it's even more capatalist and democratic than america
                - just like how america was more capitalist and democratic than the UK
                - US, india, singapore are *not* anti-british, they are post-british (monarchy)
