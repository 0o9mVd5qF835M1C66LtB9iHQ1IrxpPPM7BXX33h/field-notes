# How to Read A Book
A great many pupils do poorly in high school because of sheer ineptitude in getting meaning from the printed page. They can improve; they need to improve; but they don’t.

# Part One - The Dimensions of Reading
## Chapter 1 - The Activity and Art of Reading
There is a difference between information/facts, and understanding. Surrounded by social media, we have information, not understanding. Modern media packages information to us to make it easy for us to “make our own mind”. However, they package this information too well that the average person does not make up their own mind. They repeat the information they hear like a cassette player.

**Active Reading**
People think that reading and listening - receiving input - can be passive. Somehow our brain will absorb the information. In reality, reading and listening to input is active. It’s more similar to being a catcher in the game of baseball. Catching the ball is just as much an activity as pitching it.

The art of catching is the skill of catching every kind of pitch. Similarly, the art of reading is the skill of catching every sort of communication.

How do you actively read? This is what we will be covered in the book. Actively reading consist of a large number of separate acts.

**The Goals of Reading: Reading for Information and Reading for Understanding**
The art of reading is the operations performed by the mind to lift the reader from a state of understanding less to understanding more.

Reading for information - newspapers, magazines, etc - increases our store of information. They don’t improve our understanding.

Reading for understanding means reading something that is better/higher than the reader. There are two conditions that are necessary to read for understanding.

1. Initial inequality in understanding
2. Reader must overcome this inequality to some degree

By definition, we can only learn from our betters.

Anyone who can read at all has some ability to read this way. However, without exception, everyone has room for improvement.

If you learn to read for understanding, you also learn to read for information.

Being informed is to know facts - that something is the case. To understand is to be enlightened - besides the what, you know the why, its connections, and its similarities and differences to other facts.

The difference is being able to remember something and being able to explain it.

If you only exercise your memory, you gain nothing but information. Enlightenment is only achieved when you know why the author is saying something.

This is not to say that being informed is not important. You should remember what the author said on top of what he meant. Being informed is a prerequisite to being enlightened. But you can’t stop at being informed.

**Instruction and Learning by Discovery**
We can learn without instruction, and that's through discovery. If not, there would be no beginning to the acquisition of knowledge. Instruction is aided discovery. Where discovery, is you by yourself.

When the learner proceeds without the help of an instructor, learning is performed on the world rather than on discourse. This is [[unaided discovery]].

Reading is learning from the world. Instruction is learning from discourse.

**Present and Absent Teachers**
If you ask a teacher a question, they are present to ask you question. On the other hand, when you question a book, it answers you only to the extent that you do the work of thinking and analysis yourself. A book is like the real world.

The whole reason why everyone should learn how to read is continuing education. After school, the professor is not there to uplift you. Reading is learning from an absent teacher.

**Summary**

## Chapter 2 - The Levels of Reading
The general rule for reading: the more effort, the more understanding.

There are four levels of reading:

1. Elementary reading
2. Inspectional reading - art of skimming systematically
	If you don't inspect the reading beforehand, you are simulteaneously trying to grok the mapping of concepts as well as the concepts themselves.
3. Analytical reading - thorough reading (the best you can do)
	Analytical reading is for the sake of understanding.
4. Syntopical reading - comparative reading
	Places books in relation to others to a subject in which they all revolve (meta analysis) Rules for this this are not widely known. It's not an easy art.
	
	**Summary**

## Chapter 3 - The First Level of Reading: Elementary Reading
**Stages of learning to read**
1. Reading readiness
	Delaying reading instruction beyond this level is not neatly so serious, despite the feelings or parents who feel their children is not keeping up with their peers.
2. Reading simple materials
	After first year, children manage to master 300-400 words.
	
	Something quite mysterious, almsot magical occurs during this stage. At one moment in the course of this stage, the child finally attaches meaning to the symbols on the page. No one really knows how this happens.
3. Vocabulary building
	This is unlocking the meaning of unfamiliar words
4. Refinement and enhancement of all previous skills
	Students begin to assimilate reading experiences - carry concepts from one piece of writing to another
	
	This stage is reached by young persons in their early teens. **They should continue to build on it for the rest of their lives.**
	
	The schooling system puts a lot of emphasis on reading readiness. So much so that the higher levels of reading tend to be slighted (small in degree, inconsiderable).

**Stages and Levels**
The four stages outlined in this chapter are the stages of the **first** level of reading. Elementary reading.

Someone who finished the elementary level of reading is not yet mature. He can read on his own and is prepared to learn more about reading. But he does not know how to read beyond the elementary level.

**Higher Levels of Reading and Higher Education**
Most institutions of higher learning lack the capabilities or facilities to teach reading beyond the elementary level.

**Summary**

## Chapter 4 - The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional Reading
**Inspectional Reading I - Systematic Skimming or Pre-Reading**
1. Look at the title page and preface
2. Study table of contents
3. Check the index
4. Read publisher's blurb
5. Look at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument
6. Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a pargraph or two, sometimes several pages in sequence, never more than that

**Inspectional Reading II - Superficial Reading**
Everyone has had the experience of struggling fruitlessly with a difficult book that was begun with high hopes of enlightenment. It is natural enough to conclude that it was a mistake to try to read it in the first place. But that was not the mistake. Rather it was in expecting too much from the first going over of a difficult book.

In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.

You will have a much better chance of understanding it on a second reading, but that requires you to have read the book through at least once.

**Reading Speeds**
Our point is really very simple. Many books are hardly worth even skimming; some should be read quickly; and a few should be read at a rate, usually quite slow, that allows for complete comprehension.

With regard to rates of reading, then, the ideal is not merely to be able to read faster, but to be able to read at different speeds—and to know when the different speeds are appropriate.

Every book, no matter how difficult, contains interstitial material that can be and should be read quickly; and every good book also contains matter that is difficult and should be read very slowly.

**Fixations and Regressions**
Even worse than that, the eyes of incompetent readers regress as often as once every two or three lines—that is, they return to phrases or sentences previously read

Thus the primary task—recognized as such by all speed reading courses—is to correct the fixations and regressions that slow so many readers down. Fortunately, this can be done quite easily. Once it is done, the student can read as fast as his mind will let him, not as slow as his eyes make him

**Summary**
Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension. In any event, the speed at which they read, be it fast or slow, is but a fractional part of most people’s problem with reading.

It is generally desirable to skim even a book that you intend to read carefully, to get some idea of its form and structure.

## Chapter 5 - How to be a Demanding Reader
To use a good book as a sedative is conspicuous waste

**Essence of Active Reading - Four Basic Questions**
1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail? And how?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it?

**How to make a Book Your Own**
Marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author.

1. Underlining
2. Vertical lines at the margin
3. Star, asterisk, etc in the margin
4. Numbers in the margin
5. Numbers of other pages in the margin
6. Circling of key words or phrases
7. Writing in the margin or at top/bottom of page


# Part Two - The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading
## Chapter 6 - Pigeonholing a Book
**Importance of Classifying Books**
Rule 1 in analytical reading: You must know what kind of book you're reading, and you should know this as early as possible, preferably before you begin to read. This first rule applies to particularly non-fiction, expository works.

**Practical vs Theoretical Books**
The distinction between fiction and non-fiction/exposity works are quite easy. The challenging distinction we must go through is the difference between practical and theoretical books.

If we polish the rough truth that is here being grasped, we come to the distinction between knowledge and action as the two ends a writer may have in mind.

What we have in mind here is exemplified by the distinction between pure and applied science, or, as it is sometimes very inaccurately expressed, between science and technology.

Theoretical books teach you that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do or think you should do

## Chapter 7 - X-raying a Book
RULE 2. STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH).

RULE 3. SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE.

Rule 4. Find out what the author's problems were.

The above four rules have a single aim. To gain the knowledge of the book's structure. This is the first stage of reading it analytically. The term "stage" is not in a chronological sense, but an understanding sense. The practiced reader accomplishes all the stages of analytical reading at once. But knowing a book's structure does constitute towards reading it analytically.

## Chapter 8 - Coming to Terms with an Author
**Words vs Terms**
If a term and a word were exactly the same, you would only have to find the important words in a book in order to come to terms with it. But a word can have many meanings, especially an important word. If the author uses a word in one meaning, and the reader reads it in another, words have passed between them, but they have not come to terms. Where there is unresolved ambiguity in communication, there is no communication, or at best communication must be incomplete.

For the communication to be successfully completed, therefore, it is necessary for the two parties to use the same words with the same meanings—in short, to come to terms. When that happens, communication happens, the miracle of two minds with but a single thought.

A term is a word used unambiguously. You cannot find terms in dictionaries, though the materials for making them are there. Terms occur only in the process of communication.

Rule 5. Find the important words and through them come to terms with the author.
- The first part of the rule is locating the words
- The second part is determining the meaning of these words, as used, with precision.

This is the first rule of the second stage of analytical reading. The aim of which is not the outling of a book's structure but the interpretation of its contents or message.

The other rules in this second stage are similar to rule 5. They include two steps: a step dealing with the language, and a step beyond the language to the thought that lies behind it. The first step is gramamatical, the second one is logical. If language were a pure and perfect medium for thought, these steps would not be separate. If it were, there would be no poetry. Artful passages with subjective meaning. The likelihood of a meeting of minds through language depends on the willingness of both reader and writer to work together. Like the pitcher and catcher.



**Finding the Key Words (Step 1)**
Most of the words the author uses are not important. The words that are important are the words that matter. OK that explanation doesn't do much justice. Imagine this book right here. Of course the word "reading" is going to be important.

You cannot locate the key words without making an effort to understand the passage in which they occur. This situation is somewhat paradoxical. If you do understand the passage, you will, of course, know which words in it are the most important. If you do not fully understand the passage, it is probably because you do not know the way the author is using certain words. 

**Technical Words and Special Vocabularies**
Not every book is explained like Euclid, with technial words explicitly listed and defined. So you'll have to find the on your own.

The book's title, chapter headings, and the preface may be useful in finding the book's technical words. One technical word leads to another, so you'll discover other technical words in a similar fashion. When a field of knowledge has a well-established vocabulary, the task of locating the important words in a book is relatively easy.

**Finding the Meanings**
How does one find out what the meanings are? The answer, though simple, may appear unsatisfactory. But patience and practice will show you otherwise. The answer is that you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of all the other words in the context that you do understand. This must be the way, no matter how merry-go-roundish it may seem at first.

But most of the words in any English book are familiar words. These words surround the strange words, the technical words, the words that may cause the reader some trouble. The surrounding words are the context for the words to be interpreted. The reader has all the materials he needs to do the job.

A single word may be related to several terms. On the other hand, a single term may be related to several words.

## Chapter 9 - Determining an Author's Message
A proposition in a book is a declaration. The author affirms something they think to be true, or denies	something he judges to be false. His propositions are nothing but expressions of personal opinion unless they are supported by reasons. We want to know not merely what their propositions are, but also why they think we should be persuaded to accept them.

**Sentences vs Propositions**
Rule 6. Mark the most important sentences in the book and discover the propositions they contain.

Rule 7. Locate or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding the them in the connection of sentences.

**Finding the Key Sentences**
Most sentences in the book will cause you no difficulty. You will read them relatively quickly. The sentences important *for you* are those that require an effort of interpretation, because, at first sigh, they are not perfectly intelligible. You understand them well enough to know there is more to understand. They are the sentences that you read much more slowly and carefully than the rest. Note that these may not be the most important sentences *for the author*, but they are likely to be.

**Finding the Propositions**
There are only two differences between finding the terms that words express and the propositions that sentences express. When you find propositions, you employ a larger context by using the surrounding sentences, just like you use the surrounds words.

The other difference is that complicated sentences usually express more than one proposition.

The besy way to test if you know the propositions is to state the propositions in your own words. If you merely repeat the author's sentences with slight alterations in the words used, only words has passed from them to you, not thought or knowledge. They were trying to communicate knowledge, and all you received were words. The new sentence you have formed is not a verbical replicate of the original. It is faithful to the thought alone.

There is one other test you can conduct to check if you understand the proposition of the sentence you just read. Can you point to any personal experience you have had that the proposition describes? An experience that explifies the general truth the proposition has just declared? Imagining a possible case is as good as citing an actual one. Unless you can show your understanding of the facts that the proposition states, you're playing with words, not thoughts or knowledge.

**Finding the Arguments**
You can't find arguments by finding the most important paragraphs. This is because every author has different styles and opinions on what constitues a paragraph.

The logical unit of arguments is not directly mapped to a gramattical unit. Like how terms are created from words and propositions from sentences. An argument can be created from a complex sentence. From a paragraph. Even from multiple paragraphs.

To add to the difficutly of finding arguments, books contain paragraphs that do not express any argument at all.

Rule 7. FIND IF YOU CAN THE PARAGRAPHS IN A BOOK THAT STATE ITS IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS; BUT IF THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THUS EXPRESSED, YOUR TASK IS TO CONSTRUCT THEM, BY TAKING A SENTENCE FROM THIS PARAGRAPH, AND ONE FROM THAT, UNTIL YOU HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES THAT STATE THE PROPOSITIONS THAT COMPOSE THE ARGUMENT.

First, remember that arguments are composed of statements. If you find the conclusion of an argument first, continue the search and find the reasons. If you find the reasons first, continue to find the concluding statement.

Second, you should know if an argument is based off deductive or inductive reasoning. Deductive starts from something big and reduces (deduce) to something small. From a generalization to something specific. Inductive is the opposite.

Deductive: All things with mass fall to the ground. So I'll probably fall to the ground
Inductive: An apple falls to the ground. It has mass. So I'll probably fall to the ground.

Third, know what author's assumptions, what he says can be proved from these assumptions, and what doesn't need to be proved because they're self evident.

In logic, self-evident statements are called tautologies aka axioms. However, many people who call these statements tautologies do not realize that these statements can be further classified into two. Statements that are true in themselves because of the way they're formed.

For ex: The father of my father is my grandfather.

This statement describes itself. It's simply labelling something, namely, the father of my father. There are other statements that actually add to our knowledge

For ex: The whole is greater than the its parts.

This statement expresses our understanding of these two terms by how they're related.

**Finding the Solutions**
The final step in interpreting a book's meaning is rule 8.

Rule 8. Find out what the author's solutions are. What problems he has solved, and which he has not. As to the latter, decide which problems the author knew he had failed to solve.

**The Second Stage of Analytical Reading**
Until this point, you have been simply following the author's arguments. This completes the second stage of analytical reading. Finding the meaning of the book. Now, you have a chance to form your own opinion, express yourself, and argue with the author.

## Chapter 10 - Critizing a Book Fairly
This is the last and third stage of analytical reading. In this stage, you reap the reward for all previous efforts.

The activity of reading a book does not stop at simply understanding the book's meaning and what it says. It ends when with criticism, and adding your opinion to the book's meaning.

For example, in real life conversation regarding academic nature, when someone says something you do not understand, you will respond back with clarifying questions until you figure out their argument. But once you understand, they will want your opinion on the matter. Moreover, when you give your opinion, you make the subject matter your own. Allowing you to "hook" into the subject-matter in the future much easier.

**Teachability as a Virtue**
Forming your own opinion is the third stage of analytical reading.

Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.” Sir Walter Scott 

Teachability is often confused with subservience. For taking the book's arguments with face value. The most teachable reader is the most critical. This can only be done at the end of the book. After fully understanding the book's meaning. The book needs to be understood before it can be judged.

**The Important of Suspending Judgement**
RULE 9. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY, WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, “I UNDERSTAND,” BEFORE YOU CAN SAY ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS: “I AGREE,” OR “I DISAGREE,” OR “I SUSPEND JUDGMENT.

It's important to suspend judgement until you understand.

**The Important of Avoiding Contentiousness**
Rule 10. WHEN YOU DISAGREE, DO SO REASONABLY, AND NOT DISPUTATIOUSLY OR CONTENTIOUSLY.

**On the Resolution of Disagreements**
Rule 11. RESPECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND MERE PERSONAL OPINION, BY GIVING REASONS FOR ANY CRITICAL JUDGMENT YOU MAKE.

Knowledge, if you please, consists in those opinions that can be defended, opinions for which there is evidence of one kind or another. If we really know something, in this sense, we must believe that we can convince others of what we know. Opinion, in the sense in which we have been employing the word, is unsupported judgment. That is why we have employed the modifiers “mere” or “personal” in conjunction with it.

The first requires the reader to complete the task of understanding before rushing in. The second adjures him not to be disputatious or contentious. The third asks him to view disagreement about matters of knowledge as being generally remediable. This rule goes further: It also commands him to give reasons for his disagreements so that issues are not merely stated but also defined. In that lies all hope for resolution.

## Chapter 11 - Agreeing or Disagreeing with an Author
The first step is to know the book's structure. The second step is to understand the book's meaning. If you cannot understand the book's meaning and explain why you don't understand, then you can stop. As clearly, the book is an unintelligible once, and not a good one.

However, if you're reading a good book, you'll probably be able to understand it with some effort. The next step becomes whether you agree or disagree with it.

**Prejudice and Judgment**
If you disagree, three conditions must be satisfied to ensure your disagreement is fair.

1. Acknowledge the emotions and personal biases you bring to the dispute. You may think you have reasons, facts, and knowledge, when all you have is strong emotions.
2. You must make your own assumptions explicit. Good controversy should not quarrel about assumptions.
3. Take the other fellow's point of view with sympathy.

However, humans are flawed. The following is four ways in which a book can be critized fairly.

After the reader says "I understand but I disagree", he can make the following remarks to the author:

1. You are uninformed
2. You are misinformed
3. You are illogical - your reasoning is not cogent
4. Your analysis is incomplete

We have finally finished outling the necessary stages for analytical reading.

Stage 1 - What is the book about, as a whole?
Stage 2 - Interpreting the book's meaning. What is being said in detail, and how?
Stage 3 - Critizing a book. Is it true? And what of it?

## Chapter 18 - How to Read Philosophy

## Chapter 19 - How to Read Social Science

# Part Four - The Ultimate Goals of Reading
## Chapter 20 - The Fourth Level of Reading: Syntopical Reading

There are two requirements to any project of syntopical reading:

1. Knowing that more than one book is relevant to a particular question
2. Knowing which books should be read

The second requirement is harder to satisfy than the first.

	The author is assuming a resource like the internet does not exist?
	
You might assume that the identification of the subject matter precedes the readings of the multiple books. This might be true to some degree, narrowing your topic to love for example. But to identify beyond general topics, identification must follow reading, not precede. You'll only know what you want to talk/learn about after you read many works on the topic. And after that you might conclude that half of the works you read were not on the subject at all.


**The Role of Inspection**
Syntopical reading is not the same as reading all books in your bibliography analytically. If it were so, you would spend decades on your topic. You need to inspect books to figure out if they're worth reading, at least analytically, and with care.


**The Five Steps in Syntopical Reading**
1. Finding the relevant passages
2. Bringing the authors to terms
3. Getting the questions clear
4. Definig the issues
5. Analyzing the discussion

**The Need for Objectivity**
After reading all books in your bibliography, if you simply asserted or contradicted any point of view, than your analysis is not syntopical, but rather, just another voice in the discussion. This loses the detatched, netural, and objective point of view a syntopical analysis must have. The special quality a syntopical analysis has is "dialectical objectivity"

In short, the syntopical readers takes a look at all sides and takes no sides.

**The Syntopicon and How to Use it**
Another way to state it is in the form of what may be called the fundamental problem of syntopical reading, namely, that if you do not know where to start, you cannot read syntopically; and even if you have a rough idea of where to begin, the time required to find the relevant books and relevant passages in those books may exceed the time required to take all of the other steps combined.

## Chapter 21 - Reading and the Growth of the Mind

**What Good Books Can Do For Us**
They can improve our minds qualitatively, not just quantiatively. That is, make us wiser, not simply increase our knowledge of the world.

**The Pyramid of Books**

**The Life and Growth of the Mind**

## Notes
This book teaches you how to think, with the medium being prose.

The book does a great job in explaining and teaching you how to read the boo to the fullest. With all minutiae and what not included. They're describing the ultimate ideal, absorbing and understanding a book's message 100%.

The first half of the book explains the outline of the book, and reading as a whole. The second half of the book goes into logic. We wouldn't need the second half the book, that is, analytical reading if language was a perfect medium. There would be no need for interpretation.
