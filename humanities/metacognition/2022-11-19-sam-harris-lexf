evolution, and point of life
- you don’t think of the question “what’s the meaning of life” when you’re experiencing moments in which you feel ____. you are only asking that question when you’re abstracted away from that experience. i think that blank is flow. so the meaning of life is to serve your purpose. when you realize that, you should try to spend more time getting in flow, and being aware of your experience. every single minute *is* the show. the show and symphony is happening *now*.
- on that note, there really is no objective, purpose, to the “self”. the scientific meaning of life is to reproduce genetic offspring. and, part of darwinian natural selection has selected/molded organisms which were better at creating goals. thus, we have points like the above where we have goals to the “higher self”, since we’re stuck with machines with excellent goal achieving mechanisms.
- the next evolution of life will probably be artificial rather than biological, since our natural selection will no longer select for bigger brain size. the people with bigger brain sizes aren’t rewarded bigger gene pools. you might have a nice job, nice car, etc, but intelligent humans aren’t having more kids than non-intelligent humans


consciousness
- it’s crazy how powerful the brain is given the size and power of it. we can do things computers can’t in our skulls, with neurons that are much slower than their transistor counter part
- you don’t have any decisions over your thought. think of a random memory (thought of nikki immediately). that memory just appeared out of no where. there is no such thing as digging “deeper”, into *where* that memory came from. this apparently implies we don’t have free will.


the human brain is only done growing at 26yo
