the sovereign indvidual (1997)
==============================

FOREWARD
  - easy to point out what they got wrong
  - they missed the rise of china
  - they got a lot right though
  - ai is trying to solve the "calculation problem"
    - an i could control an economy
  - cryptography otoh is solving the decentralized, individualized world

  - if ai is communist, crypto is libertarian
    - the future may lie between these poles
    - reading the sovereign individual in 2020 is prudent


CHAPTER 1 - THE TRANSITION OF THE YEAR 2000
  - unlike the agriculture revolution, the information revolution will not take millenia to do its work
  - the information revolution will happen within a lifetime
  - also, the transformation will be universal, and happen almost everywhere at once

  - the coming revolution will liberate individuals as never before





AFTERWORD
  - devolution and the law of diminishing marginal returnsA

  - history of human societies
    - they tend to evolve towards *greater* complexity and control
    - hunter gatherers evolved into agriculture states which gave way to lager nation-states
    - the information age is the fourth turning, and will start the reverse

  - when hypertrophied systems have exhausted their potential
    - then the law of diminishing marginal returns sets in
    - we see this today, as the old instutions of social control (law/school/police)
    - they have lost effectiveness, despite their massive power and money
    - e.g. total tax 27.8% of us median income -> 37.6% from 1957 to 1997
    - this is a strong hint, if not absolute proof, of diminishing marginal returns of government activity in usa


  - in the past, sharply diminishing returns has been a prelude to *collapse*
    - collapse is what happens when a centralized control system is no longer *worth*, what it *costs*
    - the marginal returns from further investment in centralized control can become so negative
    - that it's no longer economically rational for most individuals to support the old system
    - e.g. in rome, there were simply no remaining benefits to the empire
      - the net value of local autonomy exceeded that of membership in the empire
      - both barbarians and tax collectors crossed, and ravaged the people's land
  - complexity was no longer yielding *benefits* superior to *disintegration*

  
  - threshold
    - these systems are vulnerable to radical change
    - this radical change can be precipitated by a single individual
    - this is bc the system has reached *threshold* condition

    - this individual can be *any*, they do not need to be exceptional
    - this is bc the system is analagous to a physical system
      - at any point of instability,
      - an accidental displacement of *any* one of the trillions of *idential* molecules precipitates a finite transition to a stable state

    - prophet
      - we cannot specify who or when the collapse will happen
      - we can simply see forsee collapse coming

  - 1% of americans pay the majority of income tax
    - these are precisely the people who efficient *microsovereignnties*,
    - can offer new opportunities for domicile at negligible cost in taxes
  
  - "out of all 36 ways to get out of trouble, the best way is to leave"
    - chinese proverb
    - aka voice vs exit
    - aka balaji
    - the argument of this book clearly informs the decision to redeploy your capital
    - you should never leave money in any jurisdiction that claiims the right to conscriptionn

    - to optimize wealth:
      - aim to reside in a country other than that from which you hold your first passport
      - keep the bulk of your money in a third durisdiction, preferably a tax haven
      - travel widely to acquaint yourself with alternatives you may want to secure the right to reside during emergency
      - if you're ambitious, you may even wish to carve out a minisovereignity of your own

    - if you agree with the premise of this book but lack the capital to deploy
      - your main priority should be to read and study
