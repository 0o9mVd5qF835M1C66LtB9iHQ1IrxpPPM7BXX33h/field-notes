- morison keeps returning to the conflict between innovation and conservation. He values technical innovation for satisfying human needs and desires. He also values conservation of human social structures, which are routinely destroyed by technical innovatons.
- purely and simply one of the best books ever written on the process of innovation and of technology, culture, systems, and individual personalities. Anyone in terested in the process of transofmration or the development of technilogical change shoukd read it.
- improving technological systems is not morison's goal. Instead, he warns of a basic incompatibility between technical innovation and social stability.
- for all his hesitation about innovation, morison was a great innovator as a historian. Although he completely missed the late twentieth-century expansion of the social horizon of historical study, he expanded the horizon in another way: he turned the history of technology from a study of machines to a study of humans. Instead of asking only "who invented this?" and "how does this thing work?," he also asked "what does it mean to live in a technological age, in a technological world?"

1. introductory observations, personal and otherwise
- the chracter of these ethnical periods was determined in the large part by tools available to the men living in the period: fire, bows and arrows, pottery, domesticated animals, iron working, and the alphabet. 
- but, beginning with the nineteeth century, the situation had change. "His capacity is no longer so limited; man how now learned to *manufacture power* and with the manufacture of pwoer a new epoch began
- Roosevelt warned about second order effects of the industrial evolution, just like AI
    - he believed, in fact, that if great care were not taken in the ordering of the new energies, things would jump the rails
- no intellectual heroism or psychic leap will take you from the development of the wheel immediately to the internal-combustion engine and the automobile.
    - on the other hand, if the state of one art permits a considerable advance, there is not much profit in it unless the state of other related arts supports a general forward movement
    - the greeks, for example, had a steam engine which remained a toy and was the forgotten bc there was no way for it to do work within the technological surround, no mechanical system to hook into
- it is possible, that in any very strict sense there is no such thing as an inventor or invention
    - indeed, almost any study of a new invention indicates that for consideraable periods of time before the inventor did his work other men were also doing much the same thing
- it is possible, if one sets aside the long-run social benefits, to look upon invention as a hostile act — a dislocation of existing schemes, a way of disturbing the comfortable borgeois routines and calculations, a means of discharging the restlessness w arrangements and standards t hat arbitrarily limit
- even when the new devices displaced dreadful working conditions, as in these mine shfts, the incidence and persistence of opposition are very great
    - human's monkey brains don't like change
- we have pretty well left the point where the most interesting work can be done by single men working all alone
    - Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin
- those who had spent their lives in the nineteeth century had worked with forces large enough to give them a sense for the first time in history that they were in possession of power sufficient to profoundly change the conditions of life
    - the two great influences at their disposal were steam power and the large-scale production of steel
- the point of invention from the earliest days of fire, iron, and the wheel has always been to give man some additional advantange over the natural environment
    - the interesting question seems to be whether man, having succeeded after all these years in bringing so much of the natural enviornment under his control, can now manage the imposing system he has crraeted for the specific purpose of enabling him to manage his natural environment
    - can humans manage the complexity in technical, economical, and social changes?

2. gunfire at sea: a case study of innovation
- if humans are attached to the known, to the realm of things as they are, they also, regrettably for their peace of mind, are incessantly attracted to the unknown and things as they might be
- we are thus constantly presented with new devices or new forms of power that in their refinement and extension continually bombard the fixed structure of our habits of mind and behavior
- society's reaction to innovaton comes in three stages
    1. ignoring
    2. logical, rational rebuttal
    3. name calling, argumentum ad hominem
- a less obvious cause appears by far the most important one.
    - the navy is not only an armed force; it'a society
    - men spend their whole lives in it and tend to find the definiton of their whole being within it
    - the navy o this period is a paradise for the historian or sociologist in search of evidence bearing on a society's responses to change
- the opposition, where it occurs, of the soldier and sailor to such change springs form the normla human instinct to protect oneself, and more specially, one's way of life
    - there is, as everyone knows, no place like home
    - who has ever wanted to see the old place brought under the hammer by hostile forces whether they hold a mortgage or inhabit a flying machine
    - humans have an instinctive protective feeling, even if the reasons for this feeling were not overt or recognized
- the deadlock between those who sought change and those who sought to retain things as they were was bokren only by an appeal to superior force, a force remvoed from and unidentified with the mores, conventions, devices of the society
- can society reform itself?
    - societies have not been very successful in reforming themselves, accomodating to change, without pain and conflict
    - how can we find the means to accept with less pain to ourselves and less damage too our social organization the dislocations in our society that are produced by innovation
    - by evolving, being more rational, and commiting to intellectual honesty
    - a primary source of conflict and tension in our case study appears to lie in this great word I have used so often in the summary, the word "identification"
    - humans will act defensive when their identity is attacked
- how then can we modify the dangerous effects of this word "identification"? and how much can we tamepr with this identifying process?
    - these are difficult questions to which only the most tentative and provisional answers may here be proposed for consideration
- so i would suggest that in studying innovation, we look further into this possibility
    - the possibility that any group that exists for any purpose — the family, the factory, the educational institution — might begin by defining for itself its grand object and see to it that that grand object is communicated to every member of the group
    - thus defined and communicated, it might serve as unifying agent against the disruptive local allegiances of the inveitable smaller elements that compose any group
    - it may also serve as a means to increase the acceptability of any change that would assist in the more efficient achievement of the grand object
    - for example, one team, one coinbase
- people must also be intellectually honest
- if the preceding statements are correct, they suggest that we might give some attention to the construction of a new view of ourselves as a society which in time of great change identified with and obtained security and satisfaction from the wise and creative accomodation to change itself
    - upon a relatively greater reverence for the mere process of living in a society than we possess today, and a relatively smaller respect for and attachment to any special product of a society, a product either as finite as a bathroom fixture or as conceptual as a fixed and final definition of our constitution or our democracy

3. data procesing in a bureau drawer
- bureaucracy is government by bureaus
    - this is partly true but not helpful
    - bureaucracy is hard to define, people use the symptoms to describe it
- bureaucracy is a data-processing  dsaasdafmachine
- bureaucracy is a computer system
- men in bureaus are not different from men elsewhere
    - they would rather risk their lives and reputations in keeping track of something solid and inert than of something impalpable and invisible
    - they tend to worry more over where a paper is than what has become of the things written on it
- the second thing that occurs to mind when thinking about bureaucracy is "red tape" aka "regulations"
    - regulations, in one way, are simply the generalizations drawn by the bureaus from the information they require
    - first, it's easier to make a regulation than to abolish it
    - second, it's easier to conform to a regulation even when it is inappropriate to do so, ,than it is to seek a sensible explanation
- there is a difference between administration by bureau and administration by an executive
    - the executive knows, if he is wise, that he exists to make sensible exceptions to general rules
    - the bureau knows it exists to make rules
    - the tendency to conform to rules, the regulations in this case, leads often to the maintenance of the *appearance* of things when things are, in fact, quite different
- bureaucracy carried to an extreme
    - the faith in regulation transforms the bureau into a world of its own in which forms procedures, rules, and regulations have the force of a kind of contrived law
    - men live in it as though it were real, as though there were no gunnery report not bc there was no gunnery, but bc there was there were cockroachesk
    - *bureaucracy detaches itself from truth*
- the final thing about bureaucracies: they tend to multiply
    - it's the same with any procedures designed to organize human energy in a pattern of activity
    - in order to make the pattern work, one seeks to eliminate every uncertainty and variable that might disturb the scheme
- a bureau, whether a great public ageny, a university department, or a large corporation, tends to become a world for those inside it
    - it becomes their social bubble (Standford Prison Experiment)
    - within the confides of the bureau men sometimes lose themselves in a struggle for position and power (monkey brain)
    - bureaucracy insufficiently controlled, tends to exclude another part of man's own spirit
    - though man is rational, he is also biological and emotional
- *bureaucracy stifles innovation*

4. the pertinence of the past in computing the future
- the history of man can be understood not only as the history of affections but as the effort of man to use his distinctive instrument
    - the intelligence, to triumph over the affections, the effort to introduce logic and order into the control of affairs made messy by the affections
    - man is, not only because he thinks but because he feels, and it is the interaction between these two impression energies that establishes what people today love to call the human condition
    - this means, in the end, finding out who we are, and, more painful yet, accepting it
    - then we can program our emotional necessities and desires and even, I would suppose, our aspirations
    - in other words, we can write satisfying programs for the computers when, and only when, we have learned to write satisfying programs for ourselves
    - since the machine can only simulate, the work of creating the future is still in man's hands
    - if the fails, if he misuses the machine, then in simulation it will misuse him in exactly the same way

5. a little more on the computer
- i think we may have more difficult in exploring the full limits of the computer than we have had with earlier gadgets
    - used in ignorance or stupidity, asked a foolish question, it does not collapse
    - it goes on to answer a fool according to his folly
    - the questioner being a fool will go on to act on the reply
    - this is misinformation (LLM stochastic parotting?)
    - that is, it's much harder to ask the right question than to find the right answer
    - even the right answer to the wrong question isn't worth much
- everybody, or almost everybody, seems a little uneasy about this, and why not
    - this is man's first encounter outside himself with something that is exactly like inside part of himself
    - a man working experimentally can learn something he invented more about himself, who he is and who he isn't, then he will have learned enough
    - enough to use the machine that simulates and also himself more wisely and constructively (consciousness)

6. men and machinery
