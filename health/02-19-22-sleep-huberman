factors to control circadian rhythm & sleep
    - brain and body needs queues (inputs)
    - inputs is a defined set of stimulae (levers and tools) are
        1. light/darkness
        2. temperature
            - cooling temperature increases tendency to sleep
            - converse is true w heat
        3. food
            - what, when, and how much
        4. exercise
            - increases temperature, and makes us more alert
        5. caffeine
            - adenosine antogonist (blocking receptor)
        6. supplements
            - there now exists 8 different supplements
            - mentioned three in the past, which together helps speed and depth of sleep`
            1. magnesium threonate
            2. apigenin
            3. theanine
            - others include glycine, GABA, and inositol
                - inositol helps low carb/fasting diet
                - also helps when you wake up
        7. digital tools
            - non-sleep deep rest scripts

the perfect 24hour cycle
    - regardless of when you wake up
    - increase in body temperature
        - main reason why you wake up in the first place
        - increase in body temeprature then increases release of cortisol
        - cortisol is not just stress hormone, also helps immune system, metabolism, mental focus, and body mobility in the *morning*
        - you don't want cortisol to be elevated chronically
        - you want it to reach peak early in the day (right after you wake up)
        - do this by view bright light 30 - 60mins after waking up
        - everyone can get bright light (ideally from sunlight) even with cloudy areas
        - you don't want your cortisol to spike later in the day
        - phone screen isn't bright enough to trigger cortisol spike
        - no sunglasses, or windows
    - cortisol spike
        - spike it with early morning sunlight viewing
        - look toward sun, not directly
        - do not wear sunglasses
        - get outside after the first hour of waking
    - light viewing is the most powerful stimulus towards sleep
        - it's the foundational power tool
        - if you wake up before sun has risen, then just go out when the sun does rise
        - artificial lights are not sufficiently bright to trigger sleep
        - however, these artificial lights are sufficiently bright enough to mess up your circadian rhythm
        - clear day: about 5 mins
        - cloudy day: about 10 mins
        - densely overcast: about 30 mins
        - MUST DO BEFORE 9AM
            - after 9am is the circadian dead zone
    - animals intuitvely know to get sunlight
    - if you miss a day, then do twice as much the next day
    - sunlight also washes out melatonin and adenosine


other morning tools
    1. temperature
        - increase core body temperature more quickly than normally shuffling outside
        - cold shower
            - adrenaline release AND core body temperature
            - brain realizes external body is cold, so it warms it up
        - exercise
    2. caffeine
        - delay caffeine intake 90 - 120 minutes
        - avoids afternoon crash
    3. food
        - when and how
        - if you eat early in the day --> triggers metabolism and temperature --> increases alertness
            - this sets a food entrained circadian clock

what these tools do
    - set up a cascade (wave front of wakefullness)
        - takes you through to the afternoon, to 5pm and bedtime
    - there are three daily critical period
        1. we already covered critical period one (wake up -> 3 hours after)
        2. middle day: afternoon and evening

afternoons
    1. avoid caffeine
    2. naps
        - NSDR, reveri sleep hypnosis (huberman does this almost every day)
        - most people get sleepy in the afternoon, even though your morning is healthy
    3. light
        - afternoon sunlight hasn't been explored much in the literature
        - afternoon sunlight (10/20/30 mins) protects/innoculate the nervous system from bright artificial sunlight
        - get some sunlight on low solar angle (descending), it triggers the same neurons
            - this time, it communicates with evening oscillators
            - it signals the clock that it's evening, and that sleep is coming
            - it serves as a second anchor/reference point to the body on what time it is
        - the body can tell morning/evening from the different wavelengths
            - morning: yellow/blue
            - evening: more reds/oranges
    
late evening (6pm-sleep)
    1. bright, artificial light
        - even bright, flux light will disrupt the body
        - tip: when the sun goes down, dim the lights
        - put desk lamps on floor
        - ideally: candle/moonlight (3-10 lux vs lamp 100-1000 lux)
        - avoid using overhead artificial sunlight
        - light will eliminate any melatonin
        - rule of thumb: avoid bright artificial light from 10pm-4am
        - samer hattar, director of national institute of health
            - dark cave from 9pm - 5am
    2. temperatures
        - hot shower/sauna is ok if it's 20-30 mins
        - your body will then start cooling
    3. supplements
        - magnesium threonate
        - apigenin
        - theanine
        - you don't necessarily need all three
            - although they have synergy
            - start with one, if your sleep
        - 145mcg of mgthreeoanate
        - 50mcg of apigenin
        - 100-400mg of theanine

        - 5% of people report mgthreeonate disrupts gut/digestion
            - many people who thrive on mg, that theanine actually gives vivid dreams (anxiety)
            - find the right protocol for you
        
        - ideal time its 30-60 mins before sleep
        - sleep stack is preferable to melatonin
            - melatonin is a hormone that's endogenously created by light
            - melatonin is supraphysiologically
            - it also interacts with other hormone systems
            - chronic usage can be problematic

        - in addition to sleep stack
            - every 3/4th night, in addition to sleep stack
                - if taken too often, sleep stack doesn't work effectively (anecdotal from andrew)
                - 2g of glycine
                - 100mg of GABA
            
            - every other night
                - inositol (myonositol) 900mg
                - it greatly enchances sleep
                - easier to fall back asleep
                - long tail of anxiety depression (more calmer)
                - bc it interacts w seratonin

falling back asleep
    - reveri, NSDR

jet lag
    - travel or getting woken up in the middle
    - temperature minimum
        - what is your typical wakeup time
        - if 7am, then your temperature minimum is 5am
        - temp min is 2h before your wakeup time
        - if you get up at 3am, 4am, flip bright lights, exercise, or caffeine
            - putting your clock on hold/delay, and you'll want to sleep and wake up later, the following night
        - 530am, 6am, 7am
            - will phase advanced your clock
            - make you want to go to bed and wake up earlier in night

        - if you head to time zone and need to go to bed/wake up earlier
            - the day or two before you leave, force  yourself to exercise/drink caffeine to phase advance
            - the same with delaying

    - if you need to be awake when your body needs to sleep
        - shift work, baby, head to airport, wake up at 3am to study etc
        - use red light (JOOV, KOZE light)
