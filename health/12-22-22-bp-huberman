bipolar disorder

- bp1, bp2
- bp1 is more extreme
	- 5 symptoms
	1.
	2.
	3.
	4.
	5.
- bp2 is more under the radar
	- hypomania

Heritability	
- 1% of global population has bp
- look at concordance: the likelihood of different strata: twins, fraternal twins, siblings, unrelated people, etc
- what you find
	- 25-40% chance for a twin to have major depression if the other has it
	- for bp, one twin has bpd ==> the other twin is 40%-70%
    - genetic component of bpd is much higher than md
    - conclusion: the ginetic contribution to bp, is very very high
    - the heritability of bipolar disorder, is 85%
    - very likely have a gene or set of genes to create susceptibility for bipolar disorder to present itself
    - what environment factors that trigger the disorder are not entirely clear
	- perhaps early life trauma
	- genes vs enrolment
    - 85% is not 100%
        - there is no single gene or identified gene cluster for bipolar disorder
        - someone having bipolar disorder ==> there is *something* in the ginetic lineage
        - but it's NOT like eye color, we can't deterministically forecast if someone is going to get bp


bipolar disorder vs borderline personality disorder
- very similar but distinct
- borderline personality disorder
    - could be seen as manic
    - usually there is an environment trigger
    - bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania or major depression
    - borderline personality is *almost always* (never always in biology) is going to express flights of mania or major depression through external environment or relationships
- defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder: splitting
    - they will absolutely adore you, you can do no wrong (genuine)
    - for whatever reason, perception of something you said or did, suspicion, they will suddenly *shift or split* their emotions
    - move you from a good object (can do no wrong object) to a bad object (you're cheating on them, you're mean to them, you're insulting them)
    - these shifts are still lots of suffering for the person
    - future episode on it
    - there are some emerging treatments that are showing promise
- different to distinguish between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder
    -  bipolar: no trigger!
    - borderline personality disorder: external trigger!

key point:
    - mania and depression impact lives in very negative ways
    - quite strong association with bipolar and decreative
    - extremely detrimental for the person



treatment
- lithium
    -





x=============
anti psychotics
- control serotonin 2a receptor
- modulate dopamine
- they can take someone who is actively halucinating, completely paranoid, and bring them completely back
- more typically, there it's an intermediate state
    - symptoms are reduced powerfully, but there is something still there for a while
- conceptually
    - communication within the brain
    - one part of the brain is not able to tell other parts of the brain what it's doing
    - often have conversational, inner-monologue-like quality
    - people with schizophrenia don't recognize inner monologue as inner
    - it's perceived as something coming from the outside or from inside, but another entity
    - it could be conceptualized as a communication within the brain problem (some evidence there)
