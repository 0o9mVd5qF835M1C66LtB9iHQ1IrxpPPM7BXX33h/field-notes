what is a perfect nights sleep?
    - sleep is really different from wakefulness
    - can't be replaced by any state of wakefulness
    - REM and non-REM are major states of sleep
        - every animal studied so far has these two stages of sleep
    - non-REM
        1. stage one: first fall into sleep
            - interesting rhythm, fast gama rhythm
        2. stage two: transient
        3. stage three: deep slow waves
            - cleans are brains
    - REM
        4. rapid eye movement sleep
        - most popular bc most active dreams
    
    - sleep cycle, containing 4 states is 90 minutes or so

    - first REM sleep period
        - comes about 95 minutes after sleep
        - lasts 10-15 minutes
        - start over again
    
    - perfect nights sleep is 5 cycles ==> 7.5/8 hours
    - you can't oversleep (study in dark hour)

can you oversleep?
    - different people *seem* to need different amount
    - we don't even really know what sleep is for
    - we know what sleep does, but we don't know how long is actually takes

sleep cycles, and spindles
    - sleep spindles are a small jolt of 10-15hz in frequency
    - conversation between thalamus (conscious) and cortex (processor)
    - wake from spindle might include some falling aspect
        - part of the brain thinks its falling, and report dream
    - some evidence first four hours of sleep are very important for memory processing
        - early sleep dreams will incorporate that experience much more than later dreams
        - memory moves from hippocampus to cortex (by sleep spindles)
        - no one knows why, but great study to see memory moving through different stages

growth hormone release (first cycle)
    - happens during day and evening
    - deep slow wave sleep in first cycle is when you get big bolus of growth hormone release
    - if you miss that first period, you miss your chance
    - sleep deprive
    - ==> consistent bed times AND wake times
    - alcohol negatively affects growth hormone and memory


second, third sleep cycles (second 90 minute block)
    - more and more REM sleep later in the night
    - schema (chunk)
    - later REM sleep consolidates, links, and relates different schemas

second half
    - slow wave sleep is called "deep sleep"
        - hard to arouse someone out of slow wave sleep
    - but REM sleep is the actually deeper sleep

early slow wave sleep aka "washout"
    - cleaning out, rebuilds
    - similar to growth hormone, if you miss the window, it's gone
    - few studies
        - waking up circa sunrise (within 1-2 hours)
        - and sleeping 4 hours within sunset
        - is better for health
