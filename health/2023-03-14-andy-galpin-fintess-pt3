optimize your training program for fitness and longevity

- how to combine?
- #1 failure is adherence and progression

1. plan fitness goals
  - assess properly
  - identify a training goal
  - a lot of people don't actually take that step
  - this is the most important step

  - you can do it two ways
    1. arbitrarily pick something
    2. run through fitness test
      - choose most severe performance anchor

  - SMART goals
    - specific
    - measurable (objective)
    - attainable/actionable
      - bad example is "win more games"
      - something within your control
      - also, you don't want impossible
      - take whatever your goal is, and subtract 10%

  intermediate goals
  - if you can make long-term goals (1 year, 3 year)

  - multiple goals
    1. the more specific you can be with a goal
    2. the more goals you bring, the more distraction you bring
      - the closer the adaptations, the more overlap
      - you can basically train speed and power at same time (power = speed * force)
      - strength, same thing
      - speed helps strength (f = ma)

    - hypertrophy is complementary to strength
    - endurance will compromise speed/power/strength with fatigue
      - speed/power/strength almost always improve endurance
      - but endurance may hurt speed/power/strength with fatigue
      - you could get one way interference


  - most people lie in 1 of 3 bins
  
  1. aesthetic
  2. functional
    - stronger, and more muscle
    - they care about longevity, but not primary (peter attia)
  3. longevity
    - endurance type activities
    - running, cycling, swimming, dancing, hiking
    - this is the harder bin to quantify
    - using proxy metrics
    - most athletes
    - athletes don't come to lift weights


2. identify your defender
  - what's going to stop us?
  - "i always get hurt, sore"
  - equipment, time, etc

3. goal timeframe, life events
4. weekly taining frequency
5. exercise selection, progression
6. exercise order, identify friction
7. intensity
8. volume, progrssive overload
9. rest intervals
10. chaos management





1 year program
  - evergreen
  - three goals
    1. look a certain way
    2. perform a certain way
    3. do it across your lifespan

  - important for 1x a week for proprioception

  Q1 - muscle mass
    - hypercaloric
      - above baseline, 10-15%

    - bulking up
    - sleeping more

    - sport
    - 3/4 times a week
    - 2 days a week, long walk
    - end of quarter, take deloading
    - vacation, just keep walks

  Q2 - get lean (fat loss)
    - hypocaloric
    - bring calories down a bit
    - shift indoor, to outside
    - cycling
    - 2 days a week, do weights

  Q3 - cardiovascular shape (speed, interval)
    - higher heart rate
    - high intensity
    - maintenance calories
    - track workouts (bike)
    - trail running
    - 2 days a week

  Q4 - cardiovascular (endurance)
    - long form
    - go up in calories
    - two workouts a day
