what causes aging?
- the epigenome
- aging is the loss of information due to entropy
- there are two types of information
    1. DNA (which is digital)
    2. epiginetic information (control systems of cells)

- the dna is the CD, and the epigenome is the music
    - in that cell, we have to play this set of cells
    - overtime, aging is the equivalent of scratching the CDs
    - when cells don't hear the right songs, they get messed up
- you are as old as you are look

horvath clock (development never stops)
- you have accelerated aging the first few years of your life
- then linear
- the genes that get scratched are those early developmental genes
- they seem particular susceptible to scratches

puberty rate as a determinant of aging rate
- there are some studies supporting this
- 80% is epigenitic, not genetic
- you can control your health

fasting, hunger, food choices
- big mistake: people should never be hungry
    - 20th century view: you don't want to stress the pancreas
    - the ones that live the longest are the ones that don't eat all the time
    - first discovered in early 20th century, but people ignored it
    - rediscovered in 1930s (put cellulose in food of rats so they don't get as much calories)
    - it came back in 2000s
    - researchers showed that low levels of insulin, those levels turn on the longevity genes
    - being feed all day ==> longevity genes are not turned on
    - eating all day is not letting the cell rest
- how to fast
    - when you eat is more important than what you eat
    - start with skipping a meal
        - skip either breakfast or dinner
        - attached to sleep cycle
    - liver produces glucose when it needs to
    - autophagy
        - digests old and misfolded proteins
        - macro autophagy happens naturally when you're hungry
        - deep cleanse is shaperone-mediated autophagy kicks in 2/3 days
        - mouse lives 35% older
        - sinclair tries to get 2 days, but its hard
        - sinclair's lifestyle, 110%, needs to eat one a week
    - fluids
        - electrolytes
        - make sense, but sinclair drinks tea and coffee

how does glucose trigger sirtuins?
- sirtuins respond to sugar and insulins
- mTOR respond to protein and amino acids
- when you're fasting
    - you're up sirtuin, down mTOR which triggers all body's defenses
- leucine
    - has effects on the mTOR pathway
    - weightlifters try to maximize leucine intake
    - bc leucine triggers cellular growth, it actually accelerates aging
        - sinclair: could be
    - goes back to debate: should you supplement with growth hormone

sinclair's key: pulsing
- periods of fasting, then eat, supplement, then exercise
- warrior diet: eat once per day. founded intermittent fasting
    - fasting is wonderful, but the pulses of where you nourish or even overnourish the body bc they have a tremendous effect on vitality
- vitality vs longevity
    - growth hormone is a "second puberty"
        - is caffeine a "second puberty"?
    - you don't want to take a supplement every day
    - every other day

metformin, berberine, resveratrol
- metformin: longevity drug
    - brings down sugar levels
    - type 2 diabetics live on metformin live longer than those without diabetes
    - sinclair takes metformin in the morning
    - if sinclair exercises, he skips the metformin
    - metformin doesn't prevent muscle
    - it just reduces the ability to have stamina bc it inhibits your body to have energy
    - the muscles on metformin have lower inflammation, you just won't have that extra 5%
    - but sinclair doesn't want to be a bodybuilder
    - 20% of people have a sensitivity to metformin, so if he doesn't feel great he doesn't take it
- berberine
    - substance comes from tree bark
    - take it whenever you overeat
    - works similarly to metformin
    - if there are no carbs intake, sinclair would feel lightheaded (almost hypoglycemic)
    - sinclair: "poormans metformin"
    - berberine affects ampk and mTOR pathways
    - reduces lifespan of worms
    - worms vs human trials?
    - berberine seems safe on humans
- resveratrol
    - sinclair: 1000mg per day
    - digests with a fatty substance like yogurt or oil
    - this is based on human studies
    - teaspoons of oil, dissolve the resveratrol, basil leaf, and it's like drinking salad dressing

breaking fast
- body does not have a "breaking fast light switch"
- it just speaks glucose, ampk, mTOR, etc
- answer: not scientific, it's philosophical
    - if you can't enjoy life, what's the point
    - sinclair: enjoys a cup of coffee, a bit of milk, teaspoon of yogurt, no protein/carbs in oil
    - sinclair: trying to optimize, but we don't know the perfect solution
- the whole point of this
    - do your best
    - you can't go cold turkey from eating all day to eating once a day
    - your limbic system is going to fight it
    - once you get through it, you'll be better
    - do it in stages
    - breakfast first, then small lunch, then forego lunch

iron
- accelerates aging
- excess iron wil increase the number of senescent cells
    - senescent cells causes inflamation, and cancer
    - getting rid of not accumulating ==> you stay younger
- taking iron in exccess ==> accelerating aging
- diets like sinclair
    - fairly vegetarian (not strict)
    - low hemoglobin, low iron, etc
    - but not anemic, and great energy
    - doctor just looking at the chart will say, you just need iron

- bloodwork
    - huberman gets bloodwork every 6 months
    - how do you make sense of the data?
    - you need to track these things
    - what's the code work to tell your physician for a full blood panel?
    - primary biomarkers:
        - blood sugar levels
        - average glucose levels
        - crpc (inflamation)

cholesterol
- you can eat foods that were once banned
    - eggs, butter
- it's very difficult to take cholesterol up into the body, from the gut
- everything we learned in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s are being debunked
