- radiation units
  - no more than 50mSv per calendar year
  - just living is 1-2mSv/year
  - DEXA is 20 microSV
  - it's essentially negligible
  - doing one every two weeks is a waste
  - do it once/twice a year

measurement
  1. BMD
    - BMD
    1. recorded in absolute amount (g/m^2)
    2. and in relative (z score)

  2. body fat
    - most people look for body fat
    - can be calculated in two ways
    1. total fat / total mass
    2. you can subtract bones, but they don't weigh much

  3. vat or visceral adipose tissue
    - amount of fat above the torso, and subtract the subcutaneous space
    - visceral fat is a small fraction of total body fat
    - but it's more indicitative of risk

  4. ALMI/FFMI
    - how much lean mass you have in the extremeties
    - total amount of lean tissue / height in m^2
