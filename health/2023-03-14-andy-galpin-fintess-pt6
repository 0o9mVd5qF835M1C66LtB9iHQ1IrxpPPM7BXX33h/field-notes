- wide range of supplements for the public
- 80/20 rule

creatine monohydrate
  - 15-20g per day to load
    - if you need to enhance very quickly
  - 3-5g per day
  - monohydrate
  - low side effects in anyone
  - benefits
    - phosphocreatine system
    - BMD
    - cognitive: memory, executive function, depression , mood
    - recovery
    - fat loss
    - it's not just about muscle recovery
  - it's always number 1

one from three supplements
  - fuel
    - creatine
  - stimulant
    - caffeine, beet root juice
  - fatigue blocker
    - beta alanine
    - sodium bicarbonate



fasted
  - whether carbs or fat
  - end product is
    - ATP
    - CO2
    - water
  - if your energy expenditure is low
    - you don't need fuel
    - macros matter on a 24h window
    - you don't need to eat right before working out
  - recovery starts during the previous workout
  - protein timing doesn't matter, 24h window
  - carbs timing does matter
    - maximize hydration
    - restore muscle glycogen resynthesis
    - doesn't matter if you workout every 2 days

  - hypertrophy/endurance is high energy expenditure
    - 0.5g of carbs per pound of body weight
    - protein is half of that 0.25g per lb of body weight



stimulants
  - caffeine has clear effect on endurance
  - not as clear for strength



fatigue reducers
  - you have to be careful
  - no supplement is a panacea
  - rhodiola
    - 1 or 2 papers showing it reduces muscular endurance
    - is helpful in managing cortisol
    - cortisol supression is not necessarily a good thing
    - you want it going up and down at the right times

  - slight to moderate improvement
    - power output
    - endurance
