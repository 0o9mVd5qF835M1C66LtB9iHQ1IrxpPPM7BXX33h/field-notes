speech vs language
    - considers the question a provocative one
    - been struggling for many years on this question
    - when you look at the brain, there doesn't really exist a distinction between the two

    - some people think
        - there's a separate language module in the brain
        - which influences the speech pathway on how to produce sound (output) and the auditory pathway to interpret speech (input)
        - dr. erich jarvis doesn't think there's sufficient evidence for a separate language module

    - dr. jarvis believes a speech production pathway (output)
        - built within it, has all the complex algorithms for spoken language
        - and there's an auditory perception pathway

        - the former is unique to humans and songbirds, whereas the latter is ubiquitous amongst the animal kingdom
            - this is why dogs can undertand several hundred speech words "sit"
            - but they can't speak a word

vocalization and innate language
    - sounds you make like mm and ugh for tasty or putrid smells is innate, the sounds are controlled from nerves in your neck, not brain

    - whats fascinating is the rest of human language, is all learned, not innate, similar to other animals
    - the parts of our brain responsible for speech probably evolved through the same parts responsible for bodily movement
        - hence why you'll move your arm even when talking on the phone suggest


innate predisposition to learn language
    - innate grammar
    - there is a balance between ginetic and learned

learning new or multiple languages, critical periods
    - the brain can only hold so much information
    - if you're learning new information, you also have to forget

singing, dance, and language
    - only species with language (vocal learning, the ability to immitate sounds) can dance
    - lab at duke, discovered vocal pathways in humans and parrots are embedded within circuits that control mobility
    - this is the motor theory of vocal learning origin
    - hypothesis: speech evolved in humans/parrots, it required tight integration with region of brain that responsible for hearing sound with the ones that control the areas responsible for producing sound with the larynx/tongue
    - that tight integration is argued to contaminate surrounding brain regions
        - now allows us to coordinate our muscle movements with the rest of our bodies with sound in the same way we do for speech sounds
        - we're speaking with our bodies when we dance

dancing
    - synchronizes body movement to the beat of sound
    - this kind of communication is effective rather than semantic
    - the dance brain speak essentially inherited the more ancient part of the speech circuit, which was for singing
    - this might be more for motor control of body, rather than the acquisition of language
        - e.g phoneme pronunciation, rather than grammar and vocab for instance

reading & writing
    - thought -> language -> writing ??
    - speech pathway is speaking what you're reading
        - EMG electroes on larynx muscles see's activity even though no sounds are coming out

writing vs typing
    - no studies, but dr jarvis also has personal experience
    - hypothesis: writing with hand takes less motor movement than typing
        - i.e a more primitive writing device would work better
        - essentially different pathways are competing

improving speaking (output) and understanding (input) languages
    - should kids learn how to dance? read complex books?
    - even if it's not peer-reviewed study
    - speech pathways are next to movement pathways
    - moving also means using the speech pathways
    - moving, whether it be walking, dancing, or running
