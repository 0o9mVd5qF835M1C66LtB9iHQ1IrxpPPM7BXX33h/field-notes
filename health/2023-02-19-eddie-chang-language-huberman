neuroplasticity, learning of speech
    - how the brain organizes different sound patterns?
    - raise animals in white noise (masking all sound)
        - early period of brain development where we're sensitive to sound
        - this is the critical period
        - after a couple of years, you lose sensitivty to sounds that are not part of your native languge
        - high sensitivity for your language
    - specialty for a specific language is extraordinary for a human brain which has flexibility

    - if you mask environmental sounds
        - the critical period can stay open much longer
        - it's actually a retardation
        - it's not just about ginetic programming, but also somewhat about the nature of the sounds we hear


    - animals -> humans?
        - sounds exposed to (even in womb) have influence on the structure of the brain
        - it will forever influence how neural networks are organized and structure

    - white noise during sleep for infant?
        - no answer to that question yet
        - parents are universally using white noise generators
        - there's a cost to this, we're not exposed to this naturally
        - not clear for humans, but for rats it's clear
        - dr chang didn't use white noise for his kids, but used other structure sounds (music?)

mapping speech & language in the brain
    - what are the brain areas that control speech (input) and language (semantics)?
    - brain mapping during surgery
    - patient care doesn't correlate to what the textbooks
    - this has been always controversial in neuroscience
    - modern neuroscience began
        - very much related to the discovery of language
    - first impactful observation in language
        - a patient couldn't talk, name was tan
        - he could only say "tan"
        - he could understand input, but he could only ouput "tan"
        - eventually this person passed away, and then they could look into his brain (the way neuroscience was done back then)
        - broca found this part in the back of left frontal lobe
        - claimed it was the "seat of articulation"
    - about 50 years later, story becomes more complicated
    - german neurologist carl wernicke
        - he described different set of symptoms
        - people could produce words
        - sounded fluent, but from a different language
        - word salad, or jargon
        - in addition, they did not understood input

    two observations
        1. frontal lobe responsible for articulation (output)
        2. temporal lobe responsbile for understanding (input)
        - basic idea in textbooks (even now)

    reality in patients
        - its not that simple

        1. broca's area is fundamentally wrong right now
        - frontal lobe surgeries, people talk fine
        - precentral gyrus is intimately respoonsible with motor cortex
        - motor cortex has an entire map for your body
        - there's another part responsible for jaw, larynx

        2. wernicke's area
        - has held quite legitimately for some time now        
        - have to be very careful with that area during surgery

what % of what you learned in med school is correct?
    - about 50% is right and accurate
    - another 50% is an approximation and oversimplification

lateralization of speech/language
    - mainly sit on one side of the brain
    - no matching structure on the other side

    - is this true?
        - if yes, what's the equivalent side of the brain
        - mostly true
        - if right handed, 99% of the time, the languge brain is on the left side
        - what's the right side doing?
            - it looks very similar, but not identical
            - it's not so clear

        - if left hand, 95% of the time
            - other percent, language module is on both sides or right

    - handedness is strongly ginetic
        - the parts that control the hand (motor cortex) are responsible for vocal tract
        - theory: bc of their proximity, these two areas might develop early

    - dr chang thinks the machinery exists on both sides
        - the right side might have the capability
        - but we just don't use it

bilingual
    - we know a lot
    - we use some parts of the brain very similarily
    - the two languages are heavily overlapped
    - shared machinery, but not identical
    - the memory of sequences of sounds are highly variable from one individual to the next

mapping language in the brain
    - what is the organization of language in areas of the brain?
    - is the order of brain area organized?
        - vowels, a,i,e,o,u, next together?
        - or just salt and pepper random?
    - we've been trying to answer this for the next decade
    - primary auditory cortex deep in temporal lobe
        - in that brain there is a map of different sound frequencies
        - as your march backwards, the frequencies increase
        - there's not just one, there's mirrors of that tone frequency map

    - parts of speech are very close to the tone frequency map



learning multiple languages
    - earlier
    - immersion (maintain)
    - social
        - you can only go so far from tape recording
        - there's something with real human interaction
