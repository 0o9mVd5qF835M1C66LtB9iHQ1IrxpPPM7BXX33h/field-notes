lifespan, bloodwork, biomarkers
- what gets in the way of lifespan are the four horsemen of disease
    - atherosclerotic disease
    - cancer
    - neurodeenerative disease
    - metabolic disease
    - if you're a non-smoker, your the chance of your death being one of these is 80%

    - how does bloodwork help?
    - athersclerotic
        - bloodwork is a very good predictor of risk if you know what to look for  
        - ApoB is the single most important lipoprotein that we care about it
    - nerodegenerative disease
        - there's not much insight on parkinsons disease
        - but with dimension, like Alzeimers (most prevalent), biomarkers can be quite helpful
        - overlap with athersclerotic diseases
        - same things that drive the risk of heart disease also drive the risk dimentia
    - other markers of inflamation, endothelial health, and metabolic health
    - biomarkers help with these, but there's an enormous blind spot to cancer

    - novel testing
        - genetic testing (can get out of a blood test), get a whole suite of genes which plays a more nuanced role

    - in aggregate, blood testing of biomarkers provides pretty good insight into lifespan

- healthspan, you have cognitive, physical, emotional domains
    - biomarkers are far less helpful
    - rely on functional testing
    - cognitive
        - testing
        - long-term, a lot of the things that imply good cognitive health are in line w the same things that you would to to reduce dimentia
    - physical
        - functional tests give far more insight
        - DEXA
        - CPET testing
        - VO2 max testing
        - zone two lactate testing
        - fat oxidation
    - emotional
        - biomarkers don't help at all
        - e.g. good relationship for example

- blood testing frequency
    - once a year?
    - should a 20 year old start getting blood work to get a window of what's going on?
    - everyone should be screen early in life
    - the single most prevalent genetic driver is Lp[a] Lp "little a"
    - 8-12% (perhaps as high as 20%) of the population has a high enough, Lp[a] that it is contributing to atherosclerosis
        - you're born with this, and you just need to check it once
        - it's leaving money on the table
    - frequency
        - it comes down to interventions
        - there has to be reasons
        - a blood test is a static intervention
        - it might make sense to check blood 2-4 times a year
        - but you want to actually try to move those metrics
    - quantiative measurementss on weight, BMI
        - these are kind of crude
        - rather take a DEXA anually, and then maybe follow weight a little bit more closely
        - DEXA
            - four pieces of information
            - lean mass, to non lean-mass ratio
            - telling by abs/six-pack isn't a terrible way to do it
            - a DEXA is an x-ray that can differentiate between three different things
                1. bone mineral content
                2. fat
                3. other (lean body mass: organs, muscles, etc)
            - all reports are terrible
            - attia has his own template, own dashboard
            - DEXA is a better measurement on body fat compared to calipers, buoyancy testing
            - body fat is the least interesting
            - least germane to your health (rank fourth)
            - the others are bone mineral density, visceral fat, and the metrics that can let you compute lean mass index, fat-free mass index
            - bone mineral density => risk of osteoporois and osteopenia
                - 50 year old women has more risk
                - estrogen is the single most important hormone in regulating bone mineral density
                - huge cause of morbidity
                - over age of 65 year old, one year morbidity is 35% - 40%
                - bones matter!!
                - z score of zero means you're at the 50th percentile for your age and sex
                - z score of plus one is one std dev above
                - z score of minus one is one std dev above
                - t score does the same thing but compare you to a young person
                - attia looks more at the z-score
                - some things to improve bone mineral density
                    - theres a real critical window in which we are malleable
                    - if you're under 20, 25, you're still in that time of your life where you can reach your potential
                    - strength training is the best thing you can do
                    - attia was shocked, he thought running was the best thing you can do
                    - power lifting is putting more of a sheer force from the muscle via the tendon onto the bone
                    - that's what the bone is sensing
                    - that's was activating the ostioblasts (the cells that are allowing bone to be built)
                    - more important for females
                    - how high you can get basically sets your trajectory for the rest of your life
                    - strength training is essential for life. that is preventing the fall off
                    - what does that strength training look like?
                        - fairly low rep ranges (1-6), not aiming for pump hypertrophy
                        - heavy loads that are hard to move, 80% of one rep max, done with long resting periods
                    - it's never too late to start, but you should never stop
                    - you need to train the whole body. training bone is local, but the issue is systemic
- marginal decade
    - everyone will have a marginal decade
    - most of us know when we're in that marginal decade
    - have them in exquisite detail (prompt them w 50 questions), what their marginal decade should look like. a very nuanced exploration of that topic
    - you can't design a program until you know
    - you need an objective
    - the marginal decade is the objective
    - then you delinate the objective function
    - break it down into metrics you can measure (back casting)
    - e.g. to do that, requires a VO2 max of of 3ml of O2/g
    - do the same exercise with strength and stability
    - the gravity of aging is more viscious than people realize
    - the height of your glider has to be much higher than what you think it is
    - forecasting is great for short-term things
    - backcasting is needed for long-term things
    - Annie Duke book

- all-cause mortality (ACM)
    - ACM is agnostic to how you die
    - smoking
        - 40% increase in ACM
        - you're not shortening your life by 40%, it means at any point in time, there's a 40% greater risk that you're going to die than a non-smoker
    - high blood pressure: 20-25% increase in ACM
    - kidney disease: 125% increase in ACM
    - muscle mass
        - low muscle mass compared to high muscle mass
        - low muscle mass has 3x hazard ratio (200% increase in ACM)
        - looking at the data, its less muscle mass, and more association with strength
        - 250% greater risk if you have low strength
        - attia has SMA is the strength metric assessment
    - cardio respiratory fitness
        - more profund
        - bottom quartile for their age and sex with VO2 max, compared to top quartile, 2x difference in risk of ACM
        - bottom 25% to top 2.5% (the elite), 5x difference. 400% difference in ACM
        - single strongest association for modifiable behavior
        - you don't have to be a world class elite here for 2.5%
    - you shouldn't argue about the nuance of supplets or diets (vegan, carnivore, paleo) until you can deaadlift your body weight for 10 reps
    - farmer carry your weight for two minutes (grip strength, mobility)
    - get your exercise house in order
    - until your VO2 max is at least to the 75th percentile
    - dead hang for a minute
    - wall sit for two
    - attia's rule: refrain from talking about supplements and nutrition

- centenarian decathlete
    - someone living their marginal decade the best


                    
- cholesterol
    - ringed molecule
    - 36 carbons for all i remember
    - it's a lipid, so it's a hydrophobic molecule
    - synthesized by every cell in the human body
    - it's very important
    - yes, you can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol, known in 1960
    - the cholesterol you eat does not really make it in your body. it gets esterifiedss.
    - our own cholesterol is basically recirculated in a pool throughout our body
        - it gets back into the body through this Niemann pick C1-like1 transporter
        - this is the checkpoint of regulation
        - if the body doesn't have enough, it takes it into circulation
        - it it does, it'll make the body poop it out
        - all the cholesterol in our body is not esterified
    - the cholesterol you eat is esterified
    - we manage to de-esterify 10%-15% of our dietary cholesterol
        - small amount of dietary cholesterol gets into the body's pool
    - dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol

- saturated fat is different
    - this will raise LDL cholesterol
    - saturated fat is a fatty acid
    - totally different molecule than cholesterol (which is a whole ring stuck together)
    - saturated fat is long-chain fatty acid which is fully saturated (no double bonds)
    - saturated fat can exist in isolation or tryglycerid
    - saturated fat raises LDL cholesterol is generally correct

- what is LDL cholesterol
    - every cell in the body makes cholesterol
    - usually they make enough
    - there are handful of times when a cell needs to borrow from another cell
    - if you were to design the system, you'd have to be able to transport cholesterol from one cell to another
    - most logical place to transport is circulation
    - problem with circulation is it's water (plasma)
    - problem: i want to transport cargo which is hydrophobic in a hydrophilic medium
    - blood, sodium electrolyes, glucose, they're all water soluble (it's easy)
    - but if you want to move cholesterol, you have to package it in something that's hydrophillic. that something is called lipoprotein
        - spherical molecules that are lipid on the inside, protein on the outside
        - inside, they contain cholesterol and tryglycerides
    - lipoproteins exist in different densities
    - density is a function of how much protein and lipid is in it
    - VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL
    - IDL = sum(VLDL, LDL, HDL)
    - Lp[a] is a special case of LDL
        - has another apolipoprotein
    - there are two broad categories of lipoproteins
        1. ApoAs (HDL)
        2. ApoBs (VLDL, IDL, LDL)
    - doesn't care about HDL LDL ratio
    - attia only cares about ApoB, which drives atherosclerosis
        - ApoB is the total concentration of LDL and VLDL
    - if you want to live to 100, you're going to have to keep your ApoB below 30mg/dL
    - yo uwant ApoB to be as close to the level as it was when you were born
    - we start developing heart disease when we're born
    - looking at young people dying in their 20s
    - really young Apob level 20 - 30mg/dl makes it impossible to develop ASCVD
        - nutritionally, two big pools
        - depends what is driving ApOB
        - anything that reduces cholesterol and tryglycerides
        - tryglerides are generally driven by carbohydrate intake
        - restricting carbs ==> reduce triglycerides
        - but if yo ureduce tryglycerides by increasing fat intake, you will still increase ApoB
        - ideal world, can you lower saturated fat while lowering carbohydrate
        - no one can get to a level of 30mg/dL purely on dietary intervention
        - need to look at pharmacologic
    - multiple classes
        1. tried and true: statin (inhibits cholesterol synthesis) 
            - liver is very sensitive: doesn't want too much, nor too litle
            - side effects: very benign compared to the "propaganda" out there
            - no evidence in clinical trials
            - backoff for patients with highly suprresed desmoterol levels
        2. next tool, drug that blocks reabsorption of cholesterol. ezetimibe
            - just mechanically blocks
        3. bempedoic acid
            - only affects liver
        4. pcsk8 inhibitor
            - responsible for the degradatin of LDL receptors
            - most potent

- medicine 2.0 -> medicine 3.0
    - medicine 2.0 they treat 10-year risk
    - medicine 3.0 treats causitive agent
