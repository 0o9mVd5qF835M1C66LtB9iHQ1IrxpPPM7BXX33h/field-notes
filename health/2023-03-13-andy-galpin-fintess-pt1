how to assess and improve all aspects of your fitness (pt1)
===========================================================

assessing fitness
  - many people have different levels of fitness
  - "how fit are we"
    - quite encompasing of course
    - include strength?
    - run fast?
    - hypertrophy?
    - offset asymetries?

  - how do we really assess how fit we are?
    - ask the question not as an athelete
    - perhaps someone who exercise regularly

  - when it comes to exercise, people have two goals
    1. aesthetic
      - lean
      - mass
    2. functionality
      - strength
      - mobility
      - running fast in 5k

  - we want to be able to understand
    1. where do i want to go?
    2. how do i maintain that?

  - the question comes back to
  - how do i know which area i need to focus on the most?
    - the big picture: there are several major components in fitness
    - which areÂ required in all of the categories above
    - to achieve these goals, there are handful of components
    - the methods are many, but the concepts are few





9 exercise-induced adaptions
  1. skill/technique
    - running
    - shooting
    - swinging a golf club
  2. speed
    - higher velocity
    - better acceleration
  3. power (speed * force)
  4. strength (force)
    - how much k
  5. muscle hypertrophy
    - first time we're talking about appearance
    - how big is your muscle
  6. muscular endurance
    - how many reps you can do
    - how many push ups
    - how many sit ups
    - really test local muscle
    - not a global physiological endurance
    - that's why you need multiple tests for all the groups
  7. anaerobic capacity
    - more synonymous with maximum heart rate
    - now, we're actually looking at it like a total physiological adaptatation
    - rather than a local muscle group
    - maximum work you can do in 30-45, maybe 120secs of all out work
    - interval
    - how much can you do, at a max rate, where you enter tremendous global fatigue
  8. aerobic capacity
    - maximum heart rate
    - and true VO2 max
    - 8-15m range
    - it's going to take minutes (not seconds)
  9. long duration
    - ability to sustain some maximal work
    - for a long period of time
    - no breaks, no reduction
    - steady state training
    - aka cardio
    - ability to move without any breaks or changes 
    - exceeds 15 minutes
    - can be anything past 15 minutes
    - typical is 20-60 minutes




  - if you look across the literature
    - mid 1950s
    - actually, 1927-1947
    - people were advocating a combination of
      1. strength training
      2. endurance
    - even back in 1880s

    - it became more well developed in the mid 1950s/60s
    - the initial stages of the "exercise is medicine" movement
    - the movement is happening now
    - but rooted in the 1950s
    - "health is wealth" mantra
    - if you want to maximize health, you need a combination

    - study: lifetime endurance
      - sweden skiers
      - VO2MAX
      - relatibity: ml/kg/min
        <18ml/kg/min: hard for you to live yourself (assisted living)
        20, 21, 22: you're on that threshold
          - if you get a cold, you'd have to go into assisted living
        35-38: is about the VO2 max for a college male
          - college men would have gotten eaten instead of the 90 year olds

    - typical resting heart rate for these skiiers
      - 35ml/kg/min VO2MAX ==> sub 60
      - good number regardless of age
      - literature says 60-80, which he disagrees with
      - these skiiers continued over time
      - they didn't go out of their way to "train hard"

      - the downside though is that their strength and functionality
      - it wasn't anymore superior than their stratum
      - in lifetime endurance, their cardio is better
      - but skiing is not sufficient for overall global health
      - the skiiers were leaving things on the table





genetics vs lifestyle
  - twin study
    - not reductive, organ by organ
    - it was global
    - everything
    - 35 year of difference since last exercise
    - muscle mass didn't change at all
    - muscle quality wasn't in favor of the exerciser
  - your ginetics give you a starting place
  - if you want to actually move progrss
  - you *have* to do something *besides* a single-silo
  - muscle morpholoy was complete different from his identical twin





history
  - cardio, endurance, steady state
  - body building, arnold schwartz
    - focus on technique
    - they don't care about reps
  - circuit/group training
    - they don't care about technique
    - they care about score
    - burn people out
    - roots for crossfit
  - now, we're striking a balance between the two





1. movement/skill test
  - set aside sport specific
  - this is about human movement to stay injury free
  - if you have access to a highly qualified, movement therapist
  - that's your best best
  - if you want to do it yourself though
  
  - he teaches joint by joint
    - shoulder
    - elbow
    - low back/hip
    - knee/ankle
  - use a representativee movement
    - pushup
    - pullup
    - squat
    - deadlift

  - record, front and back view
  - 3 reps
  - you want to look for 4 key things
    1. symmetry
    2. stability
    3. awareness
    4. full range of motion
  - grade
    - horrible
    - not bad
    - ok

2. speed test
  - not really necessary
  - you can infer a lot in power

3. power test
  - cost free: simple broad jump
    - super basic number is your height
    - 6ft nfl can jump 9ft
    - tip of toe to furthest point back
    - 15% less for woman
  
  - better number
    - classic vertical jump
    - mark on wall
    - do it two-handed, to remove shoulder mobility
    - measure the difference from standing and mark
    - 24in or higher
    - can come to 20in if you're 50
    - 15% less for woman

4. strength
  - grip strength
    - do right hand and left hand
    - minimum score of 40kg
    - ideally you're past 60
    - you want less than 10% variation bt left and right

  - dead hang
    - thin enough, so you can wrap your entire hand
    - going to gym, and any pull up bar
    - minimum of 30-50s
    - 60s is pretty happy
    - females tend to be better

  - upper body is fine
  - leg extension is best for average person
    - doesn't require much technique
    - can you do a leg extension of your body weight
    - past age 40, that can go about 10%
    - 170lbs, 160lb leg squat
    - you don't do need to do 1RM
    - you can do 1RM calculators
    - as long as you do less than 5 reps

  - another one is front squat hold
    - hold about half your body weight
    - 45s without break down
    - intro: third of your body weight

  - caveats
    - assuming you're technically proficient
    - warmup protocol has huge effect
    - NFCA has guides for warmup

5. hypertrophy
  - you can decide how much you want
  - there is a minimum
  - any body composition test
    - DEXA scan is the gold standard
    - pay attention to FFMI
    - fat free mass index
    - it's going to tell if you have sufficient muscle mass
    - FFMI for males should be 20
    - past 24/25 is a lot of mass (if you're lean)
    - sub 17 is bad

6. muscle endurance
  - plank
    - front for 60s
    - side for 45s
  - push ups
    - 25 consecutive push ups
    - 10 is minimum
    - 10-25 is meh
    - past 25 is ok
    - no pauses, no catching breath
    - it's not necessarily pausing
    - it's just standardizing
  - is it a strength problem or muscle endurance
    - take the same exercise as the strenght test
    - put 70% of the weight, and do it as many as you can
    - if its < 8 reps, you have a muscular endurance problems
    - if its > 8 reps, then strength

7. anaerobic test
  - not many standards
  - any protocol
    - sprinting
    - rower
    - exert maximal effort, without worrying about technical
    - minimize the variables
    - tremendous fatigue
    - 30s, 45s, or 1min how far you can travel
    - can you complete it?
    - how awful do you feel after

    - can you get close to your predicted heart rate
    - 220 - age
    - heart rate recovery is the better metric
    - looking for half a beat of recovery per second
    - 30 beats per minute
    - 60 beats per two minute
    - 90 beats per 3 minutes
    - if your recovery is worst, then we have a problem
  - in lab
    - wingate or bosco

8. aerobic test (VO2 max)
  - gold standard: lab test
  - 12 minute cooper test
    - calculator
    - anywhere from 1 to 2 mile
  - men
    - min is 35mg
    - reality, he wants above 50
    - he doesn't get stoked above 55
    - there's no human excuse to be below 60
    - ml is amount of oxygen
    - kg is body weight
    - how much oxygen can you bring in per body weight per minute


9. long duration steady state
  - aka endurance
  - you really want to hink about this as
    - not a standard number
    - you should maintain consistent work output for over 20 plus minutes
    - just pick something around your lifestyle
    - loop around your house
    - can you maintain work without stopping
    - twist can you do this with nasal breathing only
    - non-walking pace





fitness testing frequency & testing order
  - how often should we be assessing
    - pick the one that's worst, and do it most frequently
    - minimum do the full battery once a year
    - good time is beginning of the year
    - once every 6 months is good

  - order
    - non-fatiguing tests can be done whenever
    - but do it first, bc accute exercises affects
    - body composition scan, FFMI
    - don't do any hard work 48 hours before

    - movement test do it when you're most fresh
    - skill/power do it beginning of the day
    - anything fatiguing at end
      - power test: broad jump
      - leg strength test:
      - leg muscular endurance test
      - then roll right into upper body/grip strength
      - there is some influence
      - but for most people, it's not that bad
      - give yourself 15 mins

    - separate day
      - anaerobic test
      - you could do it as a long duration test
    
    - VO2 max on its own day
    - then do heart rate recovery
