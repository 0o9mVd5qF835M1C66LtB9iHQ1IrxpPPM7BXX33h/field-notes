benefits of strength & hypertrophy training
  - nike: if you have a body, you're an athlete
  - the field has failed the people
    - convinced strength training is just for athletes, or growing bigger muscles
    - cardiovascular is for fat loss or heart health
    - unecessary barriers, and false assumptions

    - it doesn't help people adverse to
      - strength training to not gain too much muscle
      - one single silo exercise for just fat loss

  - resistance and strength training is the #1 medicine to combat neuromuscular aging
  - you can't get that in any other exercise
  - human movement is a function of
    1. neuromuscular activation (nerve)
    2. muscles contract
    3. muscles move a bone
  - you lose 1% of muscle size per year after 40
  - you also lose 2-4% of *strength*S
  - you lose muscle power 8-10% per year
  - the loss of strength is double the loss of muscle
  - the problem of aging is not preservation of muscle, although it's important
  - the real problem is power and strength
    - why that matters?
    - to stand up and move
    - ability to catch yourself from a fall
    - your ability to feel confident doing a movement
    - functionality is the real name of the game
  
  - this is only going to obtained through strength and resistance training
  - you don't necessarily need to start early
    - there are *some* adaptations though that help if you start in your twenties
    - but it's like plant-based food
    - it's never too late to start

  - you don't lose functionality due to aging
    - it's exclusively caused from a *loss of movement*
    - "movement is the final common path"
    - a significant part of the brain is devoted towards our ability to move
    - and our ability to engage in resistance type movements
    - it's what keeps the brain young, healthy, and vital
    - there's a neuromuscular link!
    - people forget about that




strength vs hypertrophy
  - what is the specific adaptation they represent?
  - strength, more weight?
  - hypertrophy, more muscle fibers?

  - strength
    - an actual function
    - can you create more force across a muscle or muscle groups, or total movement

  - hypertrophy
    - is just increase in size
    - no actual mention of function
    - muscle can technically grow larger without s tronger
  
  - but, there's a strong relationship between the two
    - in the layman conversations, they're usually lumped
    - for beginners and intermediates, there's a huge overlap
    - but once you get past that, they get untangled

    - true maximal strength, 1RM maxes for the three lifts
    - compare those to body builders
    - both of those individuals are strong
    - but it's extremely clear that the powerlifters are stronger
    - and the body builders will have bigger muscle

  - thus, the idea that you need to be bigger to be stronger is not true
  - if you want to add stronger AND add muscle
    - you can do that
  - if you want to add muscle
    - some strength will come for the ride
  - however,
    - it's easy to get stronger *without* hypertrophy


  - one is simply a measure of force
  - the other is a measure of size





ligaments, tendons, resistance training
  - of course, ligaments/tendons are involved in movement
  - but do they grow/get stronger?

  - field is difficult
  - connective tissue is *not* vascular
  - their plasticity is significantly lower than skeletal muscle
  - skeletal muscle is one of the most plastic
    - pliable
    - responsive
    - going to adjust
    - it's paying attention to what's in the body

  - you can't adjust ph, nutrients, without muscle knowing about it
    - that's why muscle system is called an organ
    - biggest organ in the body is actually muscle, *not* skin
    - muscle is both listening *and* talking
    - it's controlling imune system
    - blood gucose
    - central repo for ammino acids
    - build red blood cells

  - connective tissue is not the same thing
    - we do we adaptations from strength training
    - but it's much lower
    - it's difficult to measure
    - it is beneficial
    - why strength training reduces injury
    - people who stop working out don't have any tissue tolerance
      - more significant ones are achilles tear


  - bones get stronger with strength training
    - you need to do this in your teens and twenties
    - to help bone mineral density
    - it still helps after teens/twenties
    - but it's just as a smaller rate


strength training and major adaptation
  - what are the major adaptations?
  
  - this could be an entire university course

  - what causes human movement?
    - nervous system
    - nerve has to send a signal to a motor unit
    - it's a component of many muscle fibers
    - think of it as a ponytail
    - every fiber in a motor unit is the same fiber unit
    - slow twitch or fast twitch
    - they're spread out, closer and further away from the bone

  - we see improvements in
    - firing rate
    - synchronization improvements
    - acetyl coline release

  - we haven't gotten into the actual potential yet
  - getting from electrical signal into action potential (muscle contraction)

  - from nerve -> muscle
    - contratility (muscle fibers can produce more force or more velocity, independant of muscle size)
      - this is how you get stronger without getting bigger
      - sarcoplasm riticulum (stores calcium)
      - it's for cross bridge interaction
      - the bond (calcium affinity) gets stronger

  - every step of the way of the entire skeletal muscle contraction, we see improvements
    - more force reduction, independant of any increase in size
    - we did nothing but improve efficiency

  - changing muscle fiber type
    - change from slow twitch -> fast twitch
    - fast twitch tend to be larger than slow twitch
    - but not always, especially with endurance training
      - tend to see, big slow, very metabolically effective slow twitch fibers
      - very fatigue resistant
      - not necessarily bad

  - panatian angle
    - angle at which muscle fibers interact with bone
    - muscle fibers pulling at a muscle
    - some of these are almost 90 degre
    - some are 45
    - some are parallel


    - some improve force production
    - others improve velocity
    - this is now getting into the mechanics side of it
    - how *effectively* you pull
    - strength and velocity are at odds

  - energetics
    - increase in storage of phosphocreatine
    - energy needed to power muscle at faster rate

  - all of the above are why strength and hypertrophy are strongly related





non-negotiables, non-modifiable variables of exercise training
  - we've been teasing this concept so far
  - the concepts are few, but the methods are many
  - these are the non-negotaibles, for any training program
    - true for power, speed, endurance training
  
  1. adherence
    - consistency beats intensity
    - literature shows adherence is the #1 predictor of physical fitness outcome
  
  2. progressive overload
    - you've got to have some sort of overload
    - the body works as an adaption mechanism
    - people don't realize the concept of homeostatis comes from the harvard fatigue lab
    - that's what bore the phrase "steady state"
    - the state the body wants to be in is "homeostatis"

    - we have to achieve some sort of powerload without excess
    - you need some sort of consistent predictable overload
    - this is what causes adaptation
    - if you don't do it, you'll still get
      - calories burned
      - flexibility
      - increased mood
    - but for gains in strength and hypertrophy, you need progressive overload

  3. individualization
    - personal preference
    - equipment availability

  4. appropriate target
    - know your weakest point


  - if you know all these things, you can balance
    - specificity
    - variation

  - exercides don't control adaptation
    - deadlift is the best example
    - deadlift won't increase your strength
    - unless you execute in the proper fashion
    - we're not talking about technique here
    - we're talking about these modifiable variables
    - these modifiable variables is *everything*





speed, power, strength (2-4)
  - if your high performance athlete, you need to separate
  - speed breaks down
    - acceleration
    - top end velocity
    - change of direction (agility)

  - for the layperson, they can treat speed and power as the same

  - "3 to 5"
    - 3 to 5 days per week
    - pick 3 to 5 exercises
    - 3 to 5 reps per set
    - 3 to 5 sets
    - 3 to 5 minutes of rest
    - execute all exercises at *high intent*
    - this part is critical
    - you can't improve power by moving "meh"
    - the definition of speed and power is sub maximal weights
    - the question is not whether you can lift the weights
    - you will be able to no question
    - the question is how fast

    - you can start with 3 days a week
    - then push it to 5

    - increase load over time
    - 3 to 5% per week

  - linear periodization
    - train one adaptation at a time
    - 6-8 weeks of only strength, only hypertrophy

  - ondulating periodization
    - multiple different styles of training
    - either on the same day
    - or different days

  - if you look at the studies
    - the result of both training programs is the same thing
    - they are equally effective

    - but, if your goal is specific to one outcome
    - linear periodization is better
    - downside is though you go 6-8 weeks without training the other adaptations

  - it's important to have a plan minimum per quarter
  - ideally per year





warming up, training, dynamic movements
  - you want some general global warmup
    - whole body movements
    - something that involves momentum or movement
    - old gym class (high knees)
    - moving through different planes
    - you get local and global activation
    - 5-7mins is sufficient
    - perhaps 10m is you're slow/old
    - dynamic movement is better than on the bike

  - the first movement should be the one you've prioritized
    - often times the most complex and the most moving parts
    - tends to be multi joint
    - you don't typically start your exercise with forearm curl
    - warmup whatever it takes to move perfect
    - past that, you don't have to warm up for the other exercises
    - unless you want to learn, or it's something totally different
    - you don't need to rewarm up for every other exercise





repetition cadence
  - slow on eccentric? fast on the other?
  - what are the general variables one has to consider?
  - there's an infinite amount of variations here

  - lovely question

  - the way to answer, going back first
  - if we walk through power, strength, hypertrophy
    - we see it depends
    - what's optimal for strength is diametrically opposed for hypertrophy
    - these aren't truisms
    - it all depends
    - there are cases where you should bounce
    - where you should go fast
    - etc

  - strength is movement
    - getting stronger is essentially getting better at producing a certain force through movement
    - f = ma
    - going slower is *reducing* acceleration
    - it's hard to argue that going slower is improving strength
    - you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate
    - in general, you're trying to improve at moving a heavier mass at a faster rate of acceleration
    - fast does not imply uncontrolled

  - hypertrophy is muscle size
    - hypertrophy is not that
    - it's not functional
    - your optimal cadence, is up to you
    - you can do it the same exact cadence as strength training
    - as long you modify the other variables
    - you can go slower
    - you can pause
    - you can do triphasic training

  - strength cadence for gun 3-1-1
    - 3s down
    - 1s pause (are you controlled)
    - 1s up

  - hypertrophy is the 3-1-2

  - rep cadence is not going to make much of a difference for most people

  - specificity is technically optimal
  - but it's not realistic
  - there's only so much training you can do at 90%
  - prilepin's chart





training to failure
  - for strength, you don't need to go to failure
  - just go to prilepin's
  - you can get most of what you need from technical failure (breakdown)
  - beginner: 0-5
  - intermediate: 5-20
  - advanced: 20+





exercise selection, recovery
  - you can train muscles every day
  - it comes down to volume
  - but, there is a long period of conditioning
    - building up tissue tolerance
    - in general, speed and power is so light, it's non-fatigueing
    - when people say legs, they really mean "hypertrophy legs"

  - major mistake is people change exercises too often
  - it generally takes 3 weeks to figure out
  - adherence, and standardization is the most important





power vs strength training, modifiable variables
  summary
  - 3 to 5 rule
  - power
    - weight loads on work sets: 30-70% of 1RM
    - the larger the movement, the higher you can go
    - squat can be 60%, bench no
    - scale based on range

  - strength
    - 70% or more of 1RM
    - it's okay to do less than 3 reps per set
    - less is ok (1/2)
    - more is not

  - additional work
    - like hypertrophy
    - is OK
    - but do it after
    - and you're going to sacrifice 5% of power/strength
    - it might impede by 5%
    - if goal is stricly power/strength, leave it out

  - intention
    - same idea as doing plank properly
    - with barbell, contract as hard as you can
    - you can see strength gains with 50% 1RM
    - quality > quantity
    - set your playlist before going to the gym
    - or ditch, the music
    - the quality of the training grows exponentially
    - if you don't do it intention, you'll waste your time


speed, power
  1. choice
    - in general, you want compound movements
    - multi joint movements
    - you generally want to think of movements over body groups
    - for strength and power, you want to think of movements, not body groups
      - explosion hip movements
      - pushing
      - pulling
      - rotation
      - get a reasonable balance
      - just not 6-10 weeks without one of the above

    if you're doing 3-5 pick
      1. rotation (cable machine, baseball/golf, medicine ball)
      2. push (bench pres/shoulder press)
      3. pull (row/chin)
      4. hinge (squat/deadlift)

    - you don't really worry abut eccentric here
    - it's a full body movement

  2. order
    - no cardio training before this
    - no other reptition failure
    - if you're slower, you reduce acceleration
    - you need to do this exercises when you're fresh
    - you need to do it when nervous system is most fresh
      - multiple planes
      - coordination

  3. volume
    - identical between power and strength
    - 3-20 sets, per workout
    - usually, it's 3-5
    - sometimes you can go quite higher
    - you can throw in curl, jog, but just be careful
    - don't fatigue
    - if you want to maximize strength, don't do anything else
    - if you're fine losing 5% strength for other stuff

    - superset
      - take 5mins between each set
      - study shows 2mins for most people
      - basically, you want to maximize quality


  4. frequency
    - can be as high as you like
    - if you want maximum strength, maybe few days recovery
    - generally, you can do as often as you like

  5. progression
    - 3-5% increase in intensity in general
    - upwards of 5% increase in volume at time
    - realistically, you can go 5-8 weeks
      - then deload





strength
  - rather than speed/power
  - almost identical, with a few exceptions

  1. not as much working sets
    - heavy load
    - represent some fatigue (load on tissue)

  2. intensity
    - needs to be higher than 70%
    - you want to attempt maximum speed
    - bodyweight is ok
    - but when it comes to strength, at some point
    - you need the barbell/machine for more load
    - tends to be less athletic

  3. cluster sets
    - take a mini break between each set
    - weight lifters will do cluster sets of default
    - their set of three takes a minute
    - resting 5-15s minimizes fatigue

    - it's hard for bench
    - easier for deadlift, squat
    - you could also use this as a backup
    - if you're kinda tired

  4. dynamic variable resistance
    - fixing the problem of the human strength curve
    - you're only as strong as you are, at the weakest point of the movement
    - deadlift the easiest example
      - when you pull
      - some people will fail at the bottom
      - at the knees
      - at the top
      
      - the other 2 areas don't truly get tested at their max

    - training the full part of the strength curve
    - a little more advanced



hypertrophy training program
  - summary

    1. choice
      - not super critical
      - all major/minor muscle groups
      - close to failure (-2)
      - compound/isometric
      - consistency is better than variation
    2. order
      - there's more flexibility
      - you just need to signal the nucleus
    3. volume
      - large variation
      - ideally 10-20, prob more like 15-20 sets per week
      - per muscle group
    4. frequency
      - 6-30 reps
      - most of the time 8-15 reps
      - 7-9 reps balance bt strength and hypertrophy
      - joke
        - 1-5 strength
        - 6-9 nothing happen at all
        - 8-12 hypertrophy
    5. progression
      - goal of hypertrophy
      - not necessarily add weight to a bar
      - change speed of movement, number of sets, volume

    ** bad exercises for hypertropohy
      - plyometrics
      - weight lifting variations
        - olympic
        - snatch, pulling, jerk






  - using resistance training for hypertrophy?
  - what are the different ways to induce hypertrophy?

  - a better way to think of that question:
  - what kind of stimuli do i need to give to the muscle to induce hypertrophy
  - you'll see that hypertrophy training is idiot proof, unlike strength/power
  - hypertrophy has a very long range of styles

  - strength and power as adaptations are very specific
    - they train movements
  - hypertrophy trains a response
  - classic dogma is challenge the muscle to get bigger
  - nutrients need to be there to support that growth
  - all we really have to do
    - activate something on the dge wall
    - induce the signalging cascade
    - cause neucleus to go to the ribosomes

  - it has to be strong enough, frequent enough, or combination

  - signal has to be loud enough or frequent enough for the nucleus

  - in order to grow new skeletel muscle
    1. amino acids/carbs as energy to power synthesis
    2. invest that supply



modifiable variables wrt hypertrophy
  1. exercise choice
    - strength/power was dictated by movement (push/pull)
    - with hypertrophy you can go with either
    - movement or body part

    - most people default to body part
    - movement patterns is equally effective

    - combine bilateral, and unilateral
      - good for strength
      - not as important for power
      - it's important for hypertophy sake, no imbalances
      - this is where machines come into play
      - start with big compound movements
      - go into single muscle group later

  2. exercise order
    - preference
    - it's more flexible
    - what matters more is what you're doing per week

  3. volume
    - minimum is 10 sets per week
    - most realistic is 15-20
    - even more well-trained is 25

    - reps per set gets complicated
    - as long as you're in 10-20 sets
    - and you can continue doing it 6-8 weeks at a time
    - if you're not seeing adaptation
    - you might not be repping enough

  4. frequency
    - how many reps per set?
      - 4-30 reps
      - you can even go much higher
      - the first 20 must feel light
      - caveat 1: at the end of the set, you feel *some* failure
        - get within -2 (reps of reserve)
      - caveat 2: failure is still needed
        - for advanced individuals
        - 6-8 years in training

    - rest between set
      - 30-90s 
      - it's bc you're trying to activate metabolic disruption
      - you need a bit of a burn/pump





cardio with hypertrophy?
  - answer is crossover inteference effect
  - the issue is really energy management
  - the only time endurance blocks/hinders hypertrophy is
    1. total energy intertake is off
      - just eat more
    2. avoid exercise forms that are same working group
      - running is worse than cycling
      - less eccentric pounding, loading
      - less damage
      - tissue is fine

    3. total volume
      - moderate intensity (70% of max heart rate for 30 mins)
      - prefatigued is fine
      - breaking up is better
      - second best is separate workouts
      - third best is endurance at the end

    - with high intensity
      - not as much research
      - just don't be fatigued and sore
      - or else you have to be eat carbs, to fill glycogen stores
      



nutrition
  - 1g of protein per 1lb
  - strength is 1:1 post exercise (35g of protein, 35g of carbs)
  - hard conditioning is 4:1 (100-140g of carbs, 35g of protein)
  - combination (strength/conditioning) 2:1 (60g carbs, 35g protein)
  - pure hypertrophy (3:1 ratio)

  - maximizes growth and recovery
