g7 seized $600B worth of Russian reserves
	- this signals to the rest of the world USD might not be the best currency to store reserves
	- the pretro-dollar system is starting to decline
		- oil-procuring nations: will you promise to sell your barrels of oil for USD, and then buy US treasuries with the proceeds. We will militarily guarantee your security
		- this drives up the demand because the whole world needs USD to buy oil from Saudi Arabia
		- this is what secured the USD
	- foreigners are buying less of our debt. The fed is buying
	- a chef eating it’s own cooking
	- fed is buying more of our debt with USD printed out the void
	- this system is ok when there’s faith in the dollar
	- system can’t go on forever
	- Bretton woods 3
	- commodity-based system, less trust in the international sphere. Gold, commodity, bitcoin-

- bitcoin vs gold
	- countries already have gold
	- it’s less of a leap to go back to gold then it is to bitcoin
	- obviously, bitcoin is more portable
	- easier to send

	- raking rates to 5%, us would be bankrupt
	- the only way out is a soft default
	- the US hegemony is ending
	- US was at the zenith of power in 1991, Soviet Union collapsed
	- went from multipolar world to unipolar world
	- 20 good years of unquestioned superiority 1990s to 2010s
	- no question, china will be empowered by this crisis
	- we’ve fired all our bullets
	- world might move to a multi-currency system
