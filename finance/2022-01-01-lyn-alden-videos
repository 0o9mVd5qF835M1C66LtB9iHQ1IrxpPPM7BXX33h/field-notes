Crisis of inflation:

- ray dalios long term debt cycle and fourth turning are two sides of the same coin. ray danios is quantitative and the other qualitative, social
- recession: reduction in demand, economic growth
- 2020’s is not like 70’s with vulkar days because we have lots of debt in the system. So when rates were increases to double digits, you had a recession, but not a depression. In the 40’s, debt is 100% of GDP,
- in the US, we didn’t have 50 point hikes in 20 years. Lyn thinks increasing rates is not going to fix this crisis. Bringing in more energy and commodity abundance to markets.
- during the 40’s and 70’s, inflation wasn’t a straight line. There were periods of push back (increase in supply). There will be periods of push back today as well.
- currency crisis and energy crisis together results in mayhem (Sri Lanka)
  - the catalyst of a lot of revolutions are when food and fuel prices spike
- during a recession, government will hand out stimulus. Stimulus is funded by increased taxes on succeeding companies (energy, commodity)
  - a company or investor’s in that company might device not to continue business or investing in that business, or specifically in that country if they keep getting gypped by the government
- stimulus is also created by money printing, which increases the supply of money, which increases inflation
- lyn is optimistic about energy, healthcare, commodities. The things people will still buy during a recession
  - equities don’t look good because they might have been overpriced during the leveraging part of the debt cycle. Even if adobe’s underlying business still looks good, their stock might be valued less. This is because during the leveraging period, rates are low and so instead of buying a 1% treasury bill, one would rather take higher risk to get an avg 5% return over 10 years in equities. during a recession with high inflation, and treasury yields are 3-4% one might want 8-9% return on equities for the risk, so bob has to pay a lower price on the same equity to get those higher forward returns. (Lower valuations on companies, and equities)

Will Bitcoin replace central banks?:

- emergence of the fed
  - us central banks were on/off for 20 year cycles
  - central bank was pretty limited at the time, couldn’t buy government debt
  - free banking after that, basically private money. Rates were different in each region. different states had different requirements for minimal reserves too.
  - issuance from bank of New York would be valued more because people knew they have lots of liquidity. A note from some obscure bank in the west might be discounted.
  - looked like the whole system was going to go down in the early 1900s. (Reasons are debatable between central banks and free bankers) JP Morgan acted as a bank lender of last resort. This was a centralization problem. To have a single man being the lender of last resort.
  - after the crisis was resolved, they wanted to implement a lender of last resort as part of the government, which is the fed in 1913.
  - fractional reserve banking is often misunderstood that a bank has more liabilities than assets. It’s actually the reverse. A bank has more assets then liabilities (loans versus deposits), but they don’t have all the gold on hand to pay off their liabilities.

First cracks in the fed: - fed’s mandate is to be the lender of last resort. If there’s bank run, fed’s will have the reserves to backstop liquidity on a nation wide contraction in credit (instead of JP Morgan) - after 1929 crisis, fed pulled more power to themselves. FDIC insurance was setup. Gold from fed was taken and transferred to treasury. Funny thing was fed is that it’s not really federal and it has no reserves. - FDIC was created to decentivize people to take their money out of the bank since in theory deposits were insured. - FDIC has a limit of $250,000 so it rewards the smaller guys. That’s why larger capital would rather be in a treasury. You a directly backstopped by the government. - since they don’t have reserves, they create reserves (that’s the fiat system) - even though they were on a gold standard back then, the fed didn’t actually own any gold. (This is the first crack)

Bretton woods, 1971:

- there was a gold standard during the 1800s and early 1900s
- 1930s in Breton woods, they removed the gold standard for citizens, but still allowed foreign creditors to redeem their US dollars for gold (at a lower rate as well)
- in between WWI and WWII, every country’s currency system was in shit - more bank notes than underlying gold. Anyone who’s smart will realize this, and start redeeming dollars for gold. throughout the 40’s, 50’s and 60’s, america’s gold holdings were decreasing
- if you aggressively turning dollars into gold, you would be on unfriendly terms with the United States, because you’re calling their bluff on the system. The classic example is the French who sent over a battleship to get the gold over.
- finally, Nixon said we have to “temporarily” stop the gold standard, even for foreign creditors

- it’s inevitable that central banking was implemented. With telecommunications, good accounting ledger, the world could move faster than the gold as a bearer asset could move. central banking happened in multiple places across the world
- central banking was inevitable in a world where information and commerce (via tellecommunication channels) could travel faster than money
- the order of our technologies led to the abstraction between money and currency, and central state controlling the
- pro: can move as quick as technology
- con: money dilution

Properties of good money:

- bitcoin takes the best properties of gold and fiat. It’s has slow monetary inflation rate, and scarcity of gold. It also has divisibility, portability, and verification of fiat.
- cons is relatively untested, smaller (so less liquid), more volatile, less widely held, less widely accepted.
- bitcoin is an emerging money. Smaller market means a Michael Taylor and hedge fund can come in can move the market.
- you need to look at the properties of bitcoin and determine if you want to hold it compared to other monies.
- that’s why elsavador see’s the value of it immediately. Emergent markets with unstable currencies see the value of bitcoin easier than sovereign states with central banking and the USD.
- lots of people categorize it in the speculation or investment camp. they think the behaviour of the past 13 years is going to continue.

- During monetary transitions, it’s quite common to use multiple types of money
- because bitcoin is early on in it’s monetization process, it blends the category between savings and investment
- someone with more knowledge might think of it as saving. Someone early on might think of it as investment

History of money

- commodity money, fiat money, digital money
- problem with commodity money is that technology can debase commodity currency. As technology improved, and cultures with different levels of technology interface with each other, the harder monies win out. You end up with gold and silver. That’s the history of commodity money.
- upper limit of gold is 2% increase per year. It’s a natural difficulty adjustment.
- problem with fiat money is that you get diluted by holding.
- bitcoin is the creation of commodity money in digital form. Cbdc is fiat money in digital form.
- digitization of money is inevitable. The question is which digital money becomes dominant. Bitcoin vs cbdc?
- Lyn errs on the side of bitcoin

Economic warfare in Russia & Ukraine

- freeze of Russia’s reserves
- race between Russia’s financial crisis vs europe’s commodity crisis.
