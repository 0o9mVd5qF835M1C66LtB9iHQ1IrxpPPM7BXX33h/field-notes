	- silicon is the new aluminum
	- phase 1. Digital information
	- phase 2. digital energy
	- digital revolution is dematerialization
		- we dematerialized information, Taylor estimates tens of trillions still available
		- digital energy is just starting, has hundreds of trillions available
- bitcoin is a Digital asset with monetary value
	- bitcoin is digital property

		- want to move $5 a billion dollars a day
		- you don’t need to verify trillions of dollar, just pools of $100k
	- layer 3: companies
		- custodial
		- companies are better at some things
	- layer 4: application or security backed by bitcoin
		- but you can’t withdraw
		- like buying MSTR, GBTC
