1.1 - the kingdoms of Charles stuart

- definition of revolution:
- in parliament, there was House of Lords and House of Commons. There was no “house of people”. That’s because it was only important to have the guys with money part of process. 
	- parliament must approve taxes, or else it was illegal. It was law, not an expedient. You need an approval from the rich guys.
	- to finance wars, monarchs would call a parliament, and ask it to to subsidize wars. Subsidy usually took form of a wealth tax.
	- king James inherited a kingdom with few revenue streams, lots of debt, and a lot of projects that needed funded.
	- early stuart period is plagued with financial difficulties
	- when parliament though it was being generous, it’s actual subsidies didn’t even come close to useful
- king’s historically get tonnage and poundage indefinitely
	- parliament only gave Charles tonnage and poundage for a year, because they wanted reform in economic policies after
	- Charles took that as a bitch slap, Charles and parliament’s relationship not off to a good start
	- Charles best friend was 1st duke of Buckingham. He helped Charles transition from prince to king
	- parliament wanted to impeach buckingham because he was a corrupt blunderer, and get away from the levers of power
	- Charles only had a few friends though. This combined with tonnage and poundage, in 1625, Charles dissolved parliament (which was his legal right)
- did nothing to set the royal finances in order. in 1626 he called for a new parliament, which picked up exactly where it left off
	- 1626 parliament also also started harping on religion
	- William laud and King Charles say eye to eye - he defended the king, and lectured the parliament that they’re only duty to vote the king whatever money he needs
	- most hated person is Buckingham though, second one is laud
- in June 1626, Charles dissolved his second parliament in a row.
	- Buckingham started wars with spain
	- these wars were not financed by anyone. First, he started collecting tonnage and poundage without any parliamentary grant. Cha.
	- but then, Charles also started issuing force loans. Came up a number to keep the crown solvent. Irritation was even more when Buckingham just wasted that shit on wars and got bare men killed
	- but most people still paid what they owed
	- a few resisted, and said what the king was doing was illegal
- 1628, it was clear the king and parliament needed to come to an understanding
	- charles said leave Buckingham alone. Parliament agreed but when ham on other issues: force loans, arbitrary environment, marshal law.
- parliament made Charles sign petition of rights (which limits the power of monarch)
	- king could not tax without parliament ok
	- King could not declare martial law
	- soldier not allowed in private homes during peace time
	- could not imprison without charges
- Buckingham got assassinated in august 1628 - soldier passed over for promotion. It battered Charles, and MPs pressed further for tonnage and poundage. Also pressed for the religion stuff.
	- Charles dissolved parliament again in march 1629. People were cheesed.
	- the speaker was literally held down in his chair, and the house let everyone know they disapproved Charles.
	- Charles was not amused, the hostile MPs were locked up and led to rot.
	- led to personal rule of Charles I
