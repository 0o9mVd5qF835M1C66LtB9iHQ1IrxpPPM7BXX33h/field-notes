Asset classes
- equity <— we mainly look at equity in these lessons
	- public equity
	- private equity
- credit/debt
- currency
- commodities
- real estate
- macro
etc

shkreli finance lesson 1
- first five/six things when looking at a company
	- stock (share) price
	- shares outstanding
	- market cap (SP * SO)
	- (cash - debt) net cash
	- enterprise value (EV)

Shkreli Finance Lesson 2 - income statements, balance sheets, present value discounting
- this lesson is about accounting
	- accounting is the language of finance
- holy trinity of understanding a company is
	- IS/BS/CF
	- income statement
	- balance sheet
	- cashflow
	- main focus is on IS/BS
 - balance sheet
	- assets listed in order of liqudity
		- cash
		- cash-like: marketable securities
		- A/R (net of bad debt, debt you’ll probably get back): people who owe you money
		- inventory (raw materials, WIP, finished products)
		- PP&E (property, plant, and equipment) hard asset which has a useful life of 12 months
		- goodwill/intangible asset
	- balance sheet securities
		- most corporations don’t like to own stocks on their balance sheet. They like to own bonds (even apple)
		- they want to own government bonds, not corporate bonds
		- bonds with maturity dates > 12 months is a long-term marketable security
	- liabilities are easier than assets
	- A/P (opposite of A/R)
	- accrued expenses
		- difference b/t A/P and AE is subtle
		- contract for 12 months, A/P is just individual pay cheque
	- D/R
		- most complicated concepts
		- unearned revenue
		- you haven’t given the product yet
		- upfront cash
		- software gets a lot of D/R
	- debt
		- commercial paper
		- current portion of long-term debt
		- long-term debt
- shareholder equity is assets less liabilities
	- aka book value
	- A - L = S/E aka book value
	- tangible book value also removes intangible assets like goodwill
- income statement (more fun, less account-y than balance sheet)
	- see more reality, less abstract than BS
	- revenue is sales
		- revenue recondition: when do you recognize revenue
		- rev rec
		- when: title has passed to the customer.
		- The customer now owns the asset.
		- Even when it’s on promise
		- you can book revenue on a promise
		- a lot of fraud is from intracompany revenue
		- you need to cancel intracompany revenue
		- intracompany revenue overinflated revenue
		- what if you have a $10M contract for 4 years, and they give it all upfront?
		- do you report $10M? 2.5M? $750k?
		- the rules for that is FASB, divide per quarter
		- the rest is D/R on the BS. $9.25M is on D/R, because you haven’t performed the series yet
		- lots of complexity to rev rec
		- revenue is pushing out $X amount of product out to the world
		- whether or not they did or did not get paid
	- COGS
		- cost to make the revenue
		- includes cost of labor
	- R&D
	- SG&A (selling, general and administrative) 
		- office, legal, etc
	- operating expenses
	- operating profit
		- operating margin % is operating profit/revenue
	- interest income
	- pretax income
	- taxes
	- gross profit
		- what’s leftover after revenue - COGS - R&D
		- gross margin = gross profit/revenue
	- net income
		- net margin % is net profit / revenue
- throw the BS and IS away
- what is the value of a company?
	- how do we value stuff?
	- how do we value cashflow?
	- how much do you sell this contract?
		1. I Jeff, give the owner of this contract $1 every Jan 1 forever
		2. You can sell/transfer this contract
	- what is the value of this contract?
	- Martin says $50. Will spend tremendous detail.
	- I’ll send the rest of my life what cash flow is worth
- how do we value future cash flow?
	- we know how to value today’s cash flow.
	- q: $1000 in 10 years or $100 a year for 9 years
		- this is not a guessing game. We can get a precise answer
		- this is literally what the discipline of finance is all about
	- $1 today is worth more than $1 tomorrow (usually, almost always)
		- 1. Inflation
		- 2. opportunity cost (investment potential) <— the better answer
			- opportunity cost IS risk. They are the *same*
	- this is a very theoretical part of finance. It’s almost philosophical
	- $1 today vs $1 tmr
	- $5 in 2016 > $5 in 2017 > $5 in 2018
		- $5 in 2100 approaches the value of 0 (approaches asymptote)
		- the sum of $5 from 2016 -> 2100 = $166.66
		- $5 forever is worth $166.66 today
		- discount rate is the % at which we discount the $5 each year
		- money is worth less in the future due to risk and opportunity cost
	- the #1 question of finance: what is the discount rate?
		- somewhat subjective
		- 10 year government bond interest rate is: 3%
			- there is apparently no risk in government repayment (theoretically, there is risk)
		- you loan money to different entities at different rates dependant on risk
			- US: 1.7% (LESS RISK)
			- apple: 2%
			- Brazil: 6%
			- Charlie: 10%
			- bob the crackhead: 50% (RISKEST)
		- the more risk, the more we discount
	- golden rule: discount rate = risk free rate (inflation, USG/UST bonds) + risk premium
	- most fortunes are made/lost because someone correctly predicts that a very unlikely thing happens or doesn’t happen
	- warren buffet: KO, AXP
	- warrant buffet predicted correct moats
- eventually, we will build to discounted cash flow
- you will spend a lifetime thinking in the way of DCFs
- all investment is about: what is the risk of your cash flow?

Shkreli Finance Lesson 3 - discounting cashflows
- this lessons goes more in depth of a value of company
- gold: a company is worth the discounted sum of its cashflow from today until eternity
	- it’s a pretty complete definition of the value of a company
	- it’s not perfect, but that would involve a very long conversation
	- it’s a close definition
- job of investor:
	- forecast those cashflows
	- assess risk to cash flows
	- acquire assets for less than that value or sell those assets for more than that value
- start with bonds to help understand
	- 95% of people have traded stocks and not bonds
	- you can buy bonds online too
	- shkreli demands people who work for him to trade bonds and other asset classes to get a better understanding, not just equity
	- bond is a loan
	-
